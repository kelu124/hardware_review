	abstract = {Conventional ultrasonic imaging requires acoustic scanning over a target object using a piezoelectric transducer array, followed by signal processing to reconstruct the image. Here, we report a novel ultrasonic imaging device that can optically display an acoustic signal on the surface of a piezoelectric transducer. By fabricating an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) on top of a piezoelectric crystal, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), an acousto-optical piezoelectric OLED (p-OLED) transducer is realized, converting an acoustic wave profile directly to an optical image. Because of the integrated device architecture, the resulting p-OLED features a high acousto-optic conversion efficiency at the resonance frequency, providing a piezoelectric field to drive the OLED. By incorporating an electrode array in the p-OLED, we demonstrate a novel tomographic ultrasound imaging device that is operated without a need for conventional signal processing.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound is widely used in ultrasonic detection, ultrasonography, ultrasonic oscillation, ultrasound extraction and so on. During the use of power ultrasonic transducer, the resonance frequency of the transducer tends to shift due to the changes of transducer load, aging, wear, temperature rise, fatigue and other factors. At present, there are a large number of circuit designs for automatic frequency tracking of ultrasonic transducers, but few design schemes for automatic adjustment and control of impedance matching circuit. This paper designs a circuit which can automatically adjust impedance matching based on automatic tracking of ultrasonic frequency.},

# Your review

1. It would be great if you could :
* Clarify what systematic review approach you employed in section 2.4.1. If you didn't perform a formal systematic review then I would use another term. 
  * This is indeed removed
* Consider if - in terms of language, jargon and complexity - the review is accessible to makers and hobbyists as is your stated aim in the abstract.
* Consider creating tables from sections that are long lists of components and references or manufacturers and references, to make the text flow better for the reader.


2. I have also reviewed the previous reviewer comments keeping in mind my understanding of how the article has been adjusted in response. One of your reviewers suggested: "Without figures for many subsections, the discussion is difficult to follow and remains unclear. Many sub-sections need additional details to especially understand their associated functionality in ultrasound scanning. Also, the pros and cons of the available technologies must be added for each subsection along with a brief discussion to better evaluate the feasibility of incorporating them for the open-source ultrasound hardware."

3. I cannot see that you have substantially addressed these points in each of the subsections. For example, the list of signal processing options at the end has no recommendations or discussion on which is most feasible/appropriate in the open-source/maker context. Could you explain why you were not able to address these comments?



# Reviewer 1 findings

* The paper claims is: “The aim of this paper is to identify relevant literature to consider when designing a simple open-source single-channel ultrasound device”. However, the paper mixes high-end, very complex multi-channel systems with simpler single-channel board; medical and NTD applications. Authors must clearly specify the class of the target boards and concentrate the attention on those.
  * 
* The paper would like to describe a too wide range of aspects: among others: electronics, processing, probe motorization, coupling materials, etc.  And all these in 10 pages. Often only few linens are devoted to some subject, and no discussion is presented.
  * 
* The paper was submitted not completed yet. Figure 2 is even not commented, Sec 3.4. includes just “[Hager, 2019, Hager and Benini, 2019] TO DO: also cite SUPRA @william ;)”. In Sec 3.2 this reviewer reads: “TO DO: add a figure showing the shift from RF to IF ….”.  Uploaded material includes a figure not shown in the paper. The writing of a paper requires much more care by the  authors.
  * 
* Sec 1.2 includes Amode and Bmode only. Much more modes are present in echographs.
  * 
* Sec 1.2 this review reads: “Other modes, such as M-Mode and C-Mode, combine or extend the aforementioned modes” These modes employed Doppler, and are not a “simple” extension.
  * 
* Last paragraph of sec 2.1. “Equipment suppliers…” contains several errors in the references.
  * Hope this is cleared
* It is not clear if Fig.1 behaves to single-element or multi-channel systems.
  *
* Acronyms must be defined
  * Normally processed.


# Reviewer 2 findings
 
* Corrections: Page 9 of the manuscript need corrections, some of them are the 
* (a) missing body of sub-section 3.4, 
  * 
* (b) repeated sentences in section 3.3, 
  * 
* (c) please remove the visible "TO DO" list from the manuscript particularly noticeable on page 3.
  * 
* Suggestions: Without figures for many subsections, the discussion is difficult to follow and remains unclear. 
  * 
* Many sub-sections need additional details to especially understand their associated functionality in ultrasound scanning. 
  *
* Also, the pros and cons of the available technologies must be added for each subsection along with a brief discussion to better evaluate the feasibility of incorporating them for the open-source ultrasound hardware.

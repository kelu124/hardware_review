abstract = {We extended the capabilities of functional ultrasound to whole-brain four-dimensional (4D) neuroimaging. Our multiplane-wave transmission scheme on matrix arrays at thousands of frames per second provides volumetric recordings of cerebral blood volume changes at high spatiotemporal resolution. We illustrated the approach in rats while providing multiple sensory stimuli, for 4D functional connectivity and during instantaneous tracking of epileptiform events.},

@article{Warner2013,
abstract = {We have developed and implemented a robust and practical scheme for anisotropic 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion (FWI). We demonstrate this scheme on a field data set, applying it to a 4C ocean-bottom survey over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud produces a seismic obscured area.We inverted only the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface multiples and ghosts within the field data. We invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3 to 6.5 Hz. At each iteration, we selected only a subset of sources, using a different subset at each iteration; this strategy is more efficient than inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM model building including anisotropic reflection tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as 20{\%}. The final FWI velocity model shows a network of shallow high-velocity channels that match similar features in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and moreintense low-velocity region associated with the gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the location of gas-filled faults visible in the reflection data. The resulting velocity model provides a better match to well logs, and better flattens common- image gathers, than does the starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion strategy, and algorithms that we have used have broad application to invert a wide-range of analogous data sets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

@article{Qin2016,
abstract = {Electrical brain mapping typically suffers from poor spatial resolution due to the uncertain spread of electric field lines through the brain and skull. To overcome this limitation, we propose 4D acoustoelectric brain imaging (ABI) for mapping current densities at a spatial resolution confined to the ultra-sound (US) focal spot. Acoustoelectric (AE) imaging exploits an interaction between a pressure wave and tissue resistivity. It has been used to dynamically map the cardiac activation wave in the live rabbit heart. Our long-term goal is to extend this technique for electrical mapping of the human brain. In this study, we developed a human-size head and brain phantom to test and optimize ABI for detecting an embedded 'EEG-like' electrical current. Detection thresholds for current sources more than 15 mm below the surface of the brain phantom was less than 1 mA/cm2 using a 0.5-MHz or 1 MHz single element transducer and copper recording wires. Further optimization of ABI could enable detection of small neural currents in the brain and lead to a new modality for functional brain imaging.},

To overcome this limitation, we propose 4D transcranial acoustoelectric brain imaging (tABI) for mapping current densities at a spatial resolution confined to the ultrasound (US) focus. Acoustoelectric (AE) imaging exploits an interaction between a pressure wave and tissue resistivity, which was demonstrated for mapping the cardiac activation wave in the rabbit heart. Our goal is to extend this modality for mapping the human brain noninvasively. This study describes the performance of a 2D US array designed for tABI in humans.},

However, this opportunity has not been explored in practice, since 3D US machines are only suitable for hospital usage in terms of cost, size and power requirements. In this work we propose the first fully-digital, single-chip 3D US imager on FPGA. The proposed design is a complete processing pipeline that includes pre-processing, image reconstruction, and post-processing. It supports up to 1024 input channels, which matches or exceeds state of the art, in an unprecedented estimated power budget of 6.1 W. The imager exploits a highly scalable architecture which can be either downscaled for 2D imaging, or further upscaled on a larger FPGA. Our platform supports both real-time inputs over an optical cable, or test data feeds sent by a laptop running Matlab and custom tools over an Ethernet connection. Additionally, the design allows HDMI video output on a screen.},

Currently, the communication of raw radio-frequency (RF) channel data from the probe to the computer for digital beamforming is a bottleneck. For reducing the amount of transferred data samples, this paper investigates the design of an adapted sparse sampling technique for image reconstruction inspired by the compressed sensing framework. Echo responses from isolated points are generated using a physically based simulation of ultrasound wave propagation through tissues. These point spread functions form a dictionary of shift-variant bent waves, which depend on the specific sound excitation and acquisition protocols. Speckled ultrasound images can be approximately decomposed in this dictionary where sparsity is enforced at the system matrix design. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is precomputed and used at the reconstruction stage for fast minimum-norm recovery from nonuniform pseudorandom sampled raw RF data. Results on simulated and acquired phantoms demonstrate the benefits of an optimized basis function design for high-quality B-mode image recovery from few RF channel data samples.},

However, it suffers from a number of well recognized deficiencies. Amongst these is the limited capability of white light imaging, which is restricted to analysis of the mucosal surface. Current capsule endoscopes are dependent on visual manifestation of disease and limited in regards to transmural imaging and detection of deeper pathology. Ultrasound capsule endoscopy (USCE) has the potential to overcome surface only imaging and provide transmural scans of the GI tract. The integration of high frequency microultrasound (µUS) into capsule endoscopy would allow high resolution transmural images and provide a means of both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the bowel wall. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) can provide data in an objective and measurable manner, potentially reducing lengthy interpretation times by incorporation into an automated diagnostic process. The research described here is focused on the development of USCE and other complementary diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Presently investigations have entered a preclinical phase with laboratory investigations running concurrently.},

The major image processing algorithms were achieved by the novel field programmable technology for high speed and flexibility. Real-time imaging processing was achieved by fast processing algorithms and high speed data transfer interface. Extensive tests including hardware, algorithms, wire phantom, and tissue mimicking phantom measurements were conducted to demonstrate good performance of the platform. The calculated contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the tissue phantom measurements were higher than 1.2 in the range of 3.8-8.7 mm imaging depth.

	abstract = {Pulse generator is the critical component in all ultrasound systems for driving a piezoelectric transducer to medical or nondestructive testing (NDT) applications. The transducer in ultrasound system was driven by a pulse train generator, which delivers high-voltage bipolar or unipolar pulse train. Several recent papers have discussed both the importance and the design of unipolar and bipolar pulse generator for ultrasound applications. Bipolar voltage pulse has lower unwanted DC and low-frequency component could decrease the leakage current. Also, its peak-to-peak pulse voltage could achieve twice of the voltage rating of the coaxial cable connecting the generator and the transducer. In current commercial ultrasound systems, bipolar pulse generators are commonly used; however, it still had some disadvantages like longer pulse length, which limited the driving frequency and affect the signal performance. This paper purposed a novel design of bipolar pulse generator based on a novel dual P-N channel MOSFET and FPGA timing control. It could produce multi-cycle pulses with center frequency over 50 MHz and shorter pulse length. This design also preserved the low-cost advantage compared to other commercial design of bipolar pulse generator. It is suitable for high-frequency ultrasound Doppler and B-mode imaging applications.},

However any experiment must have a reliable platform on which to develop these techniques. In my thesis work, I have designed, built, and tested a high-speed reconfigurable ultrasound beamforming platform.  
The complete receive beamformer system described in this thesis consists of hardware, firmware, and software components. All of these components work together to provide a platform for beamforming that is expandable, high-speed, and robust. The complexity of the operations being performed is hidden from the user by a simple to use and accessible software interface. 
Existing beamformer hardware is usually designed for real-time 2D image formation often using serial processing. The platform I built uses parallel processing in order to process ultrasound images 100 times faster than conventional systems. Conventional hardware is locked to a single or small number of similar transducers, while my design can be on-the-fly reprogrammed to work with nearly any transducer type. The system is also expandable to handle any size of device, while conventional systems can only handle a fixed number of device channels. The software I have created interfaces with the hardware and firmware components to provide an easy way to make use of the system’s reconfigurability. It also delivers a platform that can be simply expanded to host post-processing or signal analysis software to further fulfill a researcher’s needs.},

Array apertures are synthesized using an active multi-element receive subaperture and a multi-element transmit subaperture defocused to emulate a single-element spatial response with high acoustic power. Echo signals are recorded independently by individual elements of the receive subaperture. Each method uses different spatial frequencies and acquisition strategies for imaging, and therefore different sets of active transmit/receive element combinations. Following acquisition, image points are reconstructed using the complete data set with full dynamic focus on both transmit and receive. Various factors affecting image quality have been evaluated and compared to conventional imagers through measurements with a 3.5 MHz, 128-element transducer array on different gel phantoms. Multielement synthetic aperture methods achieve higher electronic signal to noise ratio and better contrast resolution than conventional synthetic aperture techniques, approaching conventional phased array performance.{\textless} {\textgreater}},

These functions include a set of digital signal processing functions to improve the information content of the output data stream: linear and non linear digital filtering, envelope extraction, multiple gates with programmable thresholds and data compression. Following the concept of system-on-a-chip, a processor is integrated in the FPGA. Although it is not involved in signal processing, it performs most of the internal and external communications and eases system upgrading. The Ethernet link implements the TCP/IP stack and allows networking for bidirectional communication with a host. Implementation in the FPGA hardware allows achieving high data rate transfers.

Pre-calculated delay profiles per scanline are generated in Matlab, based on physical parameters of 8 element linear transducer array which are used to steer and focus the ultrasound beam.

Flaw detectability is improved by two means: first, by migrating some traditionally analog functions, like filtering and envelope extraction to the digital domain. Second, by including some Digital Signal Processing functions in the processing chain, mainly an effective EMI noise filter and a data compression algorithm which keeps all the flaw-relevant information. These algorithms coexist with conventional gating, TGC and other advanced ultrasound processing functions in a compact, USB driven instrument},

However, the system are found to have several disadvantages such as involving ionizing radiation, taking longer time to setup, and so on. In addition, demand for the bone diagnostic is also increasing and due to that the idea to develop ultrasound circuit has emerged. The information regarding the ultrasound circuit has been studied as well as parameters related for bone density measurement. 1MHz frequency has the highest absorption for bone. The ultrasound circuit consists of a pulse generator system, high voltage pulse circuit, transducer for transmitter and receiver part, instrumentation amplifier and oscilloscope. The FPGA is chosen as a pulse generator and output from the FPGA is connected to MOSFET to create a pulse signal using a switching technique and enables voltage amplitude of the signal to be changed. The circuit was tested on human arm and heel to evaluate the signal strength with varying distance between the transducer and voltage signal amplitude. This testing proved that the A-mode ultrasound circuit is successfully transmitted ultrasound signal through human heel.},

The microcontroller in turn configures the application hardware devices such as FPGA’s, ADC’s and Ethernet chips etc. The interfacing of these devices uses address/data bus interface, serial interface or serial peripheral interface. The choice of the interface depends upon the input/output pins available with different devices, programming ease and proprietary interfaces supported by devices such as ADC’s. The novelty of this paper is to describe the programming logic used for various types of interface scenarios from microcontroller to different programmable devices. The study presented describes the methods and logic flowcharts for different interfaces. The implementation of the interface logics were in prototype hardware for ultrasound scanner. The internal devices were controlled from the graphical user interface in a laptop and the scan results are taken.

	abstract = {Mobile and cost effective ultrasound devices are used in point of care scenarios or the drama room. To reduce the costs of such devices we already presented the possibilities of consumer devices like the Apple iPad for full signal processing of raw data for ultrasound image generation. Emerging technologies like ultrafast ultrasound imaging result in new algorithms for example for shearwave elastography or vector velocity imaging but also enable the creation of a full image with only one excitation/reception event based on plane wave imaging. This way acquisition times and power consumption of ultrasound imaging can be reduced for low power mobile devices based on consumer electronics realizing the transition from FPGA or ASIC based beamforming into more flexible software beamforming. This is usually performed on a GPU utilizing massive parallel processing (like CUDA or OpenCL) but with the development of modern processors (A7, A8 and A8X) for its smartphones and tablets Apple introduced parallel GPU hardware and the framework “Metal” for advanced graphics and general purpose GPU processing for the iOS platform. We use it for medical signal reconstruction in the mobile plane wave beamforming and imaging on ultrasound channel data sets measured with our research systems “DiPhAS” in ultrafast imaging mode. We were able to integrate the beamforming reconstruction into our mobile ultrasound processing application on the iOS platform. The next step into realizing a mobile, fully software based ultrasound system was made. The beamforming can be performed at up to 62 Hz at reasonable image quality on iPad Air 2 hardware providing real time imaging including the post-processing of beamformed data into images (envelope detection and scan conversion).},

This paper focuses on the investigation of the effects of architectural design choices on the image quality. The point spread function is simulated in Field II from 10 to 160 mm using a convex array transducer. A noise analysis is performed, and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements are derived for the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and A/D converters (ADCs) to fulfill the design specifications of a dynamic range of 60 dB and a penetration depth of 160 mm in the B-mode image. Six front-end implementations are compared using Nyquist-rate and Σ∆ modulator ADCs. The image quality is evaluated as a function of the depth in terms of lateral full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and -12-dB cystic resolution (CR). The designs that minimally satisfy the specifications are based on an 8-b 30-MSPS Nyquist converter and a single-bit third-order 240-MSPS Σ∆ modulator, with an SNR for the LNA in both cases equal to 64 dB. The mean lateral FWHM and CR are 2.4\% and 7.1\% lower for the Σ∆ architecture compared with the Nyquist-rate one. However, the results generally show minimal differences between equivalent architectures. Advantages and drawbacks are finally discussed for the two families of converters.},

The transducer samples a 3-D volume by simultaneous rotation and translation, giving a helical motion. Two different 3-D SAF methods are investigated, a direct and a two-step approach. Both methods perform almost identically for simulated scatterers and give a significant improvement in azimuth resolution and a constant resolution in elevation. Side lobes below -60 dB are achievable for both methods. Validation of the method is achieved by scanning a simple wire phantom and a complex phantom containing wires in azimuth and elevation. The simple wire phantom shows the same results as that found through simulation. The complex phantom shows simultaneous focusing in azimuth and elevation for the wire scatterers. Consideration of the processing requirements for both 3-D SAF methods shows that the two-step approach can give equivalent performance using an order of magnitude fewer calculations. This reduction requires a temporary storage of 9.1 GB of data for the investigated setup.},

	abstract = {An ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging method based on a monostatic approach was studied experimentally. The proposed synthetic aperture method offers good dynamical resolution along with fast numerical reconstruction. In this study complex object data were recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower. Although it resulted in a slightly reduced spatial resolution this compromise has to be done for better resolution of low-contrast targets such as cysts. The study showed that cysts as small as 2 mm by diameter could be resolved.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

A novel mechanical sector probe was developed that utilizes a magnetic drive mechanism and custom-built servo controller for high speed and accuracy. Additionally, a very light-weight ({\textless} 0.28 g), single-element transducer was constructed and used to reduce the mass load on the motor. The imaging electronics were triggered according to the angular position of the transducer in order to compensate for the varying speed of the sector motor. This strategy ensured the production of equally spaced scan lines with minimal jitter. Wire phantom testing showed that the system axial and lateral resolutions wore 48 mum and 72 mum, respectively. In vivo experiments showed that high-frequency ultrasonic imaging at 130 fps is capable of showing a detailed depiction of a beating mouse heart.},

	abstract = {In practical cardiology, a stethoscope based auscultation has been used to reveal the patient's clinical status. Recently, several hand-held echo devices are going on market and they are expected to play a role as "visible" auscultation instead of stethoscope. We have developed a portable and inexpensive echo device which can be used for screening of cardiac function. Two single element transducers were attached 180 degrees apart to a rotor with 14-mm diameter. The mechanical scanner, integrated circuits for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals and an A/D converter were encapsulated in a 150 x 40 mm probe weighing 200 g. The scan was started and the image was displayed on a Windows based personal computer (PC) as soon as the probe was connected to USB 2.0 port of the PC. The central frequency was available between 2.5 and 7.5 MHz, the image depth was 15 cm and the frame rate was 30/s. The estimated price of this ultra-portable ultrasound is about 3000 US dollars with software. For 69 cardiac patients with informed consent, image quality was compared with those obtained with basic range diagnostic echo machines. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) derived from normal M-mode image of standard machines (EFm) were compared with visual EF of the ultra-portable ultrasound device (EFv). The image quality was comparable to the basic range diagnostic echo machines although short axis view of aortic root was not clearly visualized because the probe was too large for intercostal approach. EFv agreed well with EFm. The ultra-portable ultrasound may provide useful information on screening and health care.},

Unfortunately, ultrasound is nearly absent in many rural healthcare facilities in developing regions due to the high costs of both equipment and required training. To leverage existing healthcare systems commonly found in these contexts, we have focused our efforts on increasing the diagnostic capabilities of midwives -- often central medical figures in rural and low-income communities. We have designed and built a low-cost portable ultrasound device consisting of a USB ultrasound probe and a touchscreen netbook for a total cost of around USD3500. Compared to currently available ultrasound devices, we simplified the user interface while maintaining functionality to allow midwives to detect three common obstetrical conditions: placenta previa, multiple gestations, and breech presentation. To evaluate our solution, we tested the accuracy of ultrasound measurements, image quality, and whether midwives could use ultrasound. Testing performed by nine clinicians indicated our device would be appropriate for identifying the three conditions. Our modular design approach allows for easy modification, and the device is designed to utilize existing local healthcare resources in order to create a sustainable solution that does not depend on continuous foreign assistance.},

	abstract = {Recently there have been major advances in the electro-mechanical design of upper extremity prosthetics. However, the development of control strategies for such prosthetics has lagged significantly behind. Conventional noninvasive myoelectric control strategies rely on the amplitude of electromyography (EMG) signals from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm. Surface EMG has limited specificity for deep contiguous muscles because of cross talk and cannot reliably differentiate between individual digit and joint motions. We present a novel ultrasound imaging based control strategy for upper arm prosthetics that can overcome many of the limitations of myoelectric control. Real time ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained using a wearable mechanically scanned single element ultrasound system, and analyzed to create maps of muscle activity based on changes in the ultrasound echogenicity of the muscle during contraction. Individual digit movements were associated with unique maps of activity. These maps were correlated with previously acquired training data to classify individual digit movements. Preliminary results using ten healthy volunteers demonstrated this approach could provide robust classification of individual finger movements with 98\% accuracy (precision 96\%-100\% and recall 97\%-100\% for individual finger flexions). The change in ultrasound echogenicity was found to be proportional to the digit flexion speed (R2=0.9), and thus our proposed strategy provided a proportional signal that can be used for fine control. We anticipate that ultrasound imaging based control strategies could be a significant improvement over conventional myoelectric control of prosthetics.},

USB 2.0 is a half-duplex bus running at 480 Mb/s and each peripheral can draw as much as 500 mA of current at a nominal 5 V from the USB connector. We have developed a family of USB-based, B-mode probes that connect directly to a personal computer or laptop and that draw as little as 250 mA (1.25 W) when forming ten 5 MHz images/second. The pulser/receiver, high voltage supply, analog-to-digital converter, servo and USB interface are implemented on a small circuit board inside the probe body. After raw data are transferred to the computer, gain compensation, interpolation, filtering and other data processing are performed by the host processor. This gives flexibility to developers and allows enhancements to the system to be incorporated via software updates. In addition, the raw data are available for storage and later postprocessing. There are several advantages to this architectural approach to B-mode imaging, including low cost, portability and optimal signal-to-noise performance. This paper describes the advantages of the architecture of the probe family, discusses the hardware/software division of the required processing steps and presents example images from a 12.5 MHz ophthalmic probe.},

The FWHM has, however, been shown to sometimes provide misleading information about systems. The concept of "cystic resolution" in which performance is quantified as the size of the void that produces a specified contrast, has been previously introduced to medical ultrasound. We extend the concept and develop a general metric to analyze the 3D broadband performance of arbitrary ultrasound systems. We provide an example of application in which we compare the performance of a conventional system using a 1D array and time delay beamforming of radiofrequency (RF) data to that of a system based on a 2D array that focuses solely via phase rotation of complex I/Q data formed by directly sampling the received RF signal.},

At present, all ophthalmic ultrasound systems use focused single-element, mechanically scanned probes. A good probe positioning and image evaluation feedback requires an image refresh-rate of about 15-30 frames per second, which is achieved in commercial mechanical scanning probes by using electromagnetic motors. In this work, we report the design, construction, and experimental characterization of the first mechanical scanning probe for ophthalmic echography based on a small piezoelectric ultrasound motor. The prototype probe reaches a scanning rate of 15 sectors per second, with very silent operation and little weight.

	abstract = {Spatial resolution in modern ultrasound imaging systems is limited by the high cost of large aperture transducer arrays, which require a large number of transducer elements and electronic channels. A new technique to enhance the spatial resolution of pulse-echo imaging systems is presented. The method attempts to build an image that could be obtained with a transducer array aperture larger than that physically available. We consider two images of the same object obtained with two different apertures, the full aperture and a subaperture, of the same transducer. A suitable artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to reproduce the relationship between the image obtained with the transducer full aperture and the image obtained with a subaperture. The inputs of the neural network are portions of the image obtained with the subaperture (low resolution image), and the target outputs are the corresponding portions of the image produced by the full aperture (high resolution image). After the network is trained, it can produce images with almost the same resolution of the full aperture transducer, but using a reduced number of real transducer elements. All computations are carried out on envelope-detected decimated images; for this reason, the computational cost is low and the method is suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method was applied to experimental data obtained with the ultrasound synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), giving quite promising results. Realtime implementation on a modern, full-digital echographic system is currently being developed.},

This processor has a transducer bandwidth of 0.5 to 20 MHz and can resolve echoes 90-ns apart. The spurious products of practical mixers and amplifiers make the aliased approach impractical due to high noise and distortion. By using a bandpass filter after the mixer, distortion is reduced. A processor built with a lower sideband filter method yielded the lowest distortion and noise. The lower sideband processor has a bandwidth of 2 to 42 MHz and can resolve echoes 60-ns apart. With a single-cycle tone-burst processor input, ringing in the IF filter causes temporal asymmetry of the output pulse, while ringing in the detector filter causes ringing in the output pulse.

The presented architecture combines 2 finite impulse response (FIR) filters to process in-phase and quadrature signals and includes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that performs the required square root operations. The proposed implementation enables flexibility to support different transducers with its ability to load on-the-fly different FIR filter coefficient sets. The complexity and accuracy of the demodulator processor are analyzed with simulated RF data; a normalized residual sum-of-squares cost function is used for comparison with the Matlab Hilbert function. Three implementations are integrated into a hand-held ultrasound system for experimental accuracy and performance evaluation. Real-time images were acquired from a reference phantom, demonstrating the feasibility of using the presented architecture to perform real-time digital quadrature demodulation of ultrasonic signal echoes. Experimental results show that the implementation, using only 2942 slices and 3 dedicated digital multipliers of a low-cost and low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is accurate relative to a comparable software- based system; axial and lateral resolution of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively, were obtained with a 12-mm piezoelectric transducer without postprocessing. Because the processing and sampling rates are the same, high-frequency ultrasound signals can be processed as well. For a 15-frame-per-second display, the hand-held ultrasonic imaging-processing core (FPGA, memory) requires only 45 mW (dynamic) when using a 5-MHz single-element piezoelectric transducer.},

	abstract = {High-frequency ultrasound imaging (at {\textgreater}20 MHz) has gained widespread attention due to its high spatial resolution being useful for basic cardiovascular and cancer research involving small animals. The sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter in a high-frequency ultrasound system usually needs to be higher than 120 MHz in order to satisfy the Nyquist sampling-rate requirement. However, the sampling rate is typically within the range of 40-60 MHz in a traditional ultrasound system, and so we propose a delayed-excitation method for performing high-frequency ultrasound imaging with a traditional data acquisition scheme. In this method, the transmitted pulse is delayed by a certain time period so that the ultrasound echo data are aligned into high-sampling-rate slots. Wire and tissue-mimicking phantoms were imaged to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, whereas a porcine small-intestine specimen and an excised rabbit eyeball were used for in vitro imaging evaluations. The test results demonstrate that the proposed method allows high-frequency ultrasound imaging to be implemented using a traditional ultrasound sampling system.},

The FPGA is used to control, acquire, store, delay-and-sum, and transfer the data for real-time co-registered imaging. The FPGA controls the ultrasound transmission and ultrasound and photoacoustic data acquisition process of a customized 16-channel module that contains all of the necessary analog and digital circuits. The 16-channel module is one of multiple modules plugged into a motherboard; their beamformed outputs are made available for a digital signal processor (DSP) to access using an external memory interface (EMIF). The FPGA performs a key role through ultrafast reconfiguration and adaptation of its structure to allow real-time switching between the two imaging modes, including transmission control, laser synchronization, internal memory structure, beamforming, and EMIF structure and memory size. It performs another role by parallel accessing of internal memories and multi-thread processing to reduce the transfer of data and the processing load on the DSP. Furthermore, because the laser will be pulsing even during ultrasound pulse-echo acquisition, the FPGA ensures that the laser pulses are far enough from the pulse-echo acquisitions by appropriate time-division multiplexing (TDM). A co-registered ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system consisting of four FPGA modules (64-channels) is constructed, and its performance is demonstrated using phantom targets and in vivo mouse tumor models.},

This array based pulsed-wave Doppler system included a 16-channel HF analog beamformer, a HF pulsed-wave Doppler module, timing circuits, HF bipolar pulsers, and analog front-ends. The beamformed echoes acquired by the 16 channel analog beamformer, were directly fed to the HF pulsed-wave Doppler module. Then the in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) audio Doppler signals were digitized by either a sound card or a Gage digitizer and stored in a PC. The Doppler spectrogram was displayed on a PC in real time. The two-way beam-widths were determined to be 160 μm to 320 μm when the array was electronically focused at different focal points at depths from 5–10 mm. A micro flow phantom, consisting of a polyimide tube with inner diameter of 127 μm, and the wire phantom were used to evaluate and calibrate the system. The results show that the system is capable of detecting motion velocity of the wire phantom as low as 0.1 mm/s, and detecting blood-mimicking flow velocity in the 127 μm tube lower than 7 mm/s. The system was subsequently used to measure the blood flow in vivo in two mouse abdominal superficial vessels with diameters of approximately 200 μm, and a mouse aorta close to the heart. These results demonstrated that this system may become an indispensable part of the current HF array based imaging systems for small animal studies.},

Generally, these systems aim at a particular application or target material. To make these systems portable and more adaptable to the test environments, this study presents a reconfigurable ultrasonic testing system (RUTS), which possesses dynamic reconfiguration capabilities. RUTS consists a fully programmable Analog Front-End (AFE), which facilitates beamforming and signal conditioning for variety of applications. RUTS AFE supports up to 8 transducers for phased-array implementation. Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) based Zedboard provides the back-end processing of RUTS. The powerful ARM embedded processor available within Zynq SoC manages the ultrasonic data acquisition/processing and overall system control, which makes RUTS a unique platform for the ultrasonic researchers to experiment and evaluate a wide range of real-time ultrasonic signal processing applications. This Linux-based system is utilized for ultra-sonic data compression implementation providing a versatile environment for further development of ultrasonic imaging and testing system. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the capabilities of RUTS by performing ultrasonic data acquisition and data compression in real-time. Thus, this reconfigurable system enables ultrasonic designers and researchers to efficiently prototype different experiments and to incorporate and analyze high performance ultrasonic signal and image processing algorithms.},

In this paper, a technique for in vivo mechanical strain imaging of the skin based on high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is presented. Elastic skin properties are assessed applying suction to the skin surface with a stepwise increased vacuum and estimating the resulting displacements in a spatially resolved manner. Acquired radio frequency (R-F) echo signals and their envelope are analyzed for this purpose. A computer-controlled vacuum system with a digital pressure control loop was developed for precise and reproducible deformation. In a first processing step, the skin surface is segmented. Local axial strains inside the skin are estimated from axial displacements, which are estimated from consecutive echo signal frames analyzing the phase of the complex cross correlation function of analytical echo signals. Furthermore, speckle tracking is applied to estimate axial and lateral displacements and to quantify axial and lateral strains. The correlation coefficient of windowed echo signals compensated for displacements are used as a measure to validate the estimated strains, which is essential to accomplish reliable in vivo measurements. Phantom experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Results of in vivo measurements are presented, showing the potential for mechanical strain imaging in the skin in vivo.},

A great limitation of previous high frequency systems has been the requirement to water-couple the mechanically-scanned transducer to the object to be imaged, and slowly scan the transducer using a fixed motion system. In this system, we have integrated a high-speed actuator used in conjunction with a low mass transducer enclosed in a hand-held scanhead, which allows direct placement on the eyelid or skin. The design of this system is optimized for high frame rates and clinical versatility. Implemented on this system are B-scan, M-mode, and swept-scan imaging modes, with velocity estimation in the latter two. A series of experiments were performed to characterize system performance. The system provides a frame rate of 10 fps, which is partially limited by the execution time of the software. Phantom images from the scanner have 8-bit resolution with a SNR in excess of 35 dB, providing sharp, high-resolution images},

As previous designs have utilized costly electromagnetic motors, for the mechanical scanning translation, this mechanical scanning mechanism provides a highly simplified alternative. The mechanical scanning mechanism utilizes a single piezoelectric bimorph as the actuating element. Laser Doppler analysis of the transducer motion has shown that transducer deflections greater than 10 mm can be obtained for a large range of frequencies, from 40 to 120 Hz. This, in turn, results in a maximum theoretical frame rate of 240 fps. Peak deflections greater than 20 mm can be obtained at the scanning mechanism resonance (110 Hz). Additionally, an analysis of the transducer phase relative to the input voltage has shown that high phase stability (+/- 1.4 degrees) potentially eliminates the need for position encoders, further reducing the device complexity and cost.},

The I/Q data are generated by directly sampling the received radio frequency (RF) signal, rather than through conventional baseband demodulation. We describe our efficient hardware implementation of the beamformer, which results in significant reductions in beamformer size and cost. We also present the results of experiments and simulations that compare the DSIQ beamformer to more conventional approaches, namely time delay beamforming and traditional complex demodulated I/Q beamforming. Results that show the effect of an error in the direct sampling process, as well as dependence on signal bandwidth and system f number (f\#) are presented.

La littérature des deux dernières décennies présente diverses approches visant à miniaturiser la technologie de l’IMU. Plusieurs auteurs proposent des solutions en matière d’intégration des circuits frontaux ou de matérialisation de nouveaux algorithmes de traitement des signaux ultrasoniques. Les efforts de recherche dans ce domaine sont propulsés par l’intérêt grandissant des marchés et par le développement de nouvelles applications qui bénéficient de la miniaturisation de cette technologie. De plus, les performances grandissantes des circuits intégrés programmables tels que les FPGA offrent les caractéristiques appropriées pour la mise en œuvre de nouveaux systèmes d’IMU.----------ABSTRACT
This Ph.D. thesis is related to the design of a new architecture of ultrasound medical imaging (UMI) system. We propose a fully hardware-based processor dedicated to real-time ultrasonic signal processing, which incorporates a preprocessing core, a low-power memory, an interpolation unit, and a priority assignment unit. This Ph.D. thesis represents an important contribution towards the complete integration of an ultrasound preprocessing system within the probe and the implementation of a new type of wireless UMI device.  During the last two decades, several UMI system miniaturization approaches have been presented in the literature. Some Authors proposed their front-end circuit integration and introduced hardware-based ultrasound signal processing units based on new algorithms. Research efforts in this area are driven by the increasing industrial interest on miniaturized UMI devices and by the development of new applications that benefit from the miniaturization of this technology. Moreover, the increasing performance of programmable circuits, such as FPGA, offers appropriate characteristics for the implementation of new UMI systems.  Most UMI system architectures found in the literature are based in whole or in part on a software implementation that uses a central processing unit (CPU) or a digital signal processor (DSP). This software approach provides flexibility and facilitates the implementation of processing algorithms which are becoming ever more effective and complex. However, to provide real-time ultrasound image processing, these systems require high-power consumption or are too large for a complete system integration on a single chip (SoC).},

Such scenarios can be eradicated by incorporating ambient intelligence in PUS. In this paper, we propose an architecture for a PUS system, whose abilities include automated kidney detection in real time. Automated kidney detection is performed by training the Viola–Jones algorithm with a good set of kidney data consisting of diversified shapes and sizes. It is observed that the kidney detection algorithm delivers very good performance in terms of detection accuracy. The proposed PUS with kidney detection algorithm is implemented on a single Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, integrated with a Raspberry Pi ARM processor running at 900 MHz.},

	abstract = {A compact medical ultrasound beamformer architecture that uses oversampled 1-bit analog-to-digital (A/D) converters is presented. Sparse sample processing is used, as the echo signal for the image lines is reconstructed in 512 equidistant focal points along the line through its in-phase and quadrature components. That information is sufficient for presenting a B-mode image and creating a color flow map. The high sampling rate provides the necessary delay resolution for the focusing. The low channel data width (1-bit) makes it possible to construct a compact beamformer logic. The signal reconstruction is done using finite impulse response (FIR) filters, applied on selected bit sequences of the delta-sigma modulator output stream. The approach allows for a multichannel beamformer to fit in a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. A 32-channel beamformer is estimated to occupy 50\% of the available logic resources in a commercially available midrange FPGA, and to be able to operate at 129 MHz. Simulation of the architecture at 140 MHz provides images with a dynamic range approaching 60 dB for an excitation frequency of 3 MHz.},

To achieve these goals, Teratech leveraged its unique silicon system-on-a-chip capability, and dramatically reduced the typical rack-mounted conventional system to a Terason SmartProbeTM weighing approximately 10 ounces (0.28 kg). Employing Teratech's proprietary charge domain processing, the beamformer supports a continuous computation throughput of 10.2 billion operations/s and a delay update rate of 10 billion bits/s while consuming less than 1 W, providing more than 10-fold savings in power and weight compared to the conventional implementation. The system is linked to a host PC through an IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. FireWire) serial cable.

	abstract = {The applications of ultrasound in medicine have been increasing in the last decade either in diagnostics or in treatments. Ultrasound is routinely used in clinical examinations, such as pregnancy exams. On the other hand, a typical ultrasound system costs somewhere between 100k\$ to 250k\$ because of its (1) expensive ultrasound transducers, (2) large driving electronics, (3) processing and visualization units. High cost and large volume of the ultrasound systems prevent even wider usage of these systems. It is possible to extent the use of ultrasound in clinic environment like a stethoscope, if the size and cost had been reduced orders of magnitude. The aim of this work is to develop an ultraportable and very low cost diagnostic ultrasound imaging probe; by combining inertial sensors with the probes. The manual motion of the probe by the operator's hand movement enables scanning. The position of the probe is tracked using inertial sensors. Finally, the acoustic reflections are registered together by the help of position information of the probe to form an image.},

The focus of this work was to develop an easy-to-use platform kit (hardware and software) for providing the community a complete experimental setup for ultrasound imaging at a low cost, without the need for expensive and non-modifiable specific equipment. The goal of this work resembles the needs of medical systems in the 80’s where analog techniques using single-sensor devices were prominent. To this end, two open-source, arduino-like modules have been developed for building a simple, yet complete, single-channel analog front-end system, where all the intermediary signals are readily accessible by the user. A single-channel architecture avoids the beamforming overhead, though it limits the quality of the captured image, and brings simplicity to the system. The modules were tested using re-purposed ultrasound mechanical probes, as well as non-medical transducers. Furthermore, different digital acquisition systems were utilized for providing the images of interest. The developed modules can also be used in Radio Frequency (RF) projects, non-destructive testing and control projects, as well as in low-cost medical imaging projects on non-living samples.},

Video capsule endoscopy is currently commercially available worldwide. However, it is limited to visualization of superficial tissue. Ultrasound (US) imaging is a complementary solution as it is capable of acquiring transmural information from the tissue wall. This paper presents a mechanical scanning device incorporating a high-frequency transducer specifically as a proof of concept for US capsule endoscopy (USCE), providing information that may usefully assist future research. A rotary solenoid-coil-based motor was employed to rotate the US transducer with sectional electronic control. A set of gears was used to convert the sectional rotation to circular rotation. A single-element focused US transducer with 39-MHz center frequency was used for high-resolution US imaging, connected to an imaging platform for pulse generation and image processing. Key parameters of US imaging for USCE applications were evaluated. Wire phantom imaging and tissue phantom imaging have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A porcine small intestine specimen was also used for imaging evaluation in vitro. Test results demonstrate that the proposed device and rotation mechanism are able to offer good image resolution ( 60 μm) of the lumen wall, and they, therefore, offer a viable basis for the fabrication of a USCE device.},

Since the probe orientation is the main information involved in the pose reconstruction, this work presents and investigates several tracking methods for the probe orientation, exploiting a sensor fusion technique to filter the noisy measurements coming from inertial sensors. The performances of a Kalman filter, a nonlinear complementary filter and a quaternion-based filter as inertial trackers have been tested by means of a robot manipulator, in terms of readiness, accuracy and stability of the estimated orientation signal. The results show that the nonlinear complementary filter and the quaternion-based filter match all the application requirements (RMSE {\textless}3deg, variance {\textless}1deg2, and settling time {\textless}0.3s), and they involve a lower computational time with respect to the Kalman filter.},

For these reasons in this article it is addressed a FPGA implementation of a system that synthesizes a phase manipulated signal with great duration-bandwidth product, which duration and frequency are adjustable. Furthermore, a significant change in the compressor's phase detectors is proposed, replacing the commonly used lowpass filters by a moving average filter.

	abstract = {There has been an emerging interest in high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for therapeutic applications. By means of its thermal or mechanical effects, HIFU is able to serve as a direct tool for tissue ablation, or an indirect moderating medium to manipulate microbubbles or perform heating (hyperthermia) for the purpose of targeted drug delivery. The development and testing of HIFU based phased arrays is favorable as their elements allow for individual phasing to steer and focus the beam. While FDA has already approved tissue ablation by HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids (2004) and pain from bone metastases (2012), development continues on other possible applications that are less forgiving of incomplete treatment, such as thermal necrosis of malignant masses.Ideally, each element, of such an array must have its own fully programmable electrical driving channel, which allows the control of delay, phase, and amplitude of the output from each element. To enable full control, each channel needs a waveform generator, an amplification device, and an impedance matching circuit between driver and acoustic element.Similar projects utilizing this approach to drive therapeutic arrays include a 512-channel therapy system which was built at the University of Michigan using low cost Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) microcontroller and highly efficient MOSFET switching amplifiers [1]. However, this system lacks the ability to drive both, continuous wave (CW) and transient short duty-cycle high power pulses.This paper presents a hybrid system, which is able to perform CW and transient short duty-cycle high power excitation. In the following we will describe the design, programming, fabrication, and evaluation of this radiofrequency (RF) driver system as used in our laboratory for a 1.5 MHz center frequency, 298-element array (Imasonic SA, Besancon, France) [2], FPGA-controlled amplifier boards and matching circuitry. Advantages of our design include: 1. Inexpensive components ({\textless}\$15/channel); 2. Ability to program/drive individual output channels independently; 3. Sufficient time and amplitude resolution for various acoustic pattern design; 4. Capability of hybrid switching between low power CW and short duty cycle, high instantaneous power.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ultrasound is a powerful imaging technique, but it requires thousands of sensors and complex hardware. Very recently, the discovery of compressive sensing has shown that the signal structure can be exploited to reduce the burden posed by traditional sensing requirements. In this spirit, we have designed a simple ultrasound imaging device that can perform three-dimensional imaging using just a single ultrasound sensor. Our device makes a compressed measurement of the spatial ultrasound field using a plastic aperture mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor. The aperture mask ensures that every pixel in the image is uniquely identifiable in the compressed measurement. We demonstrate that this device can successfully image two structured objects placed in water. The need for just one sensor instead of thousands paves the way for cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices and possible new clinical applications.
Compressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.

Advances in the production of small sized PZT ceramic powder allow the development ofthinner ceramic layers for this application. Sol gel composite thin film technology also provides a new technique for producing ceramic coatings of a thickness that successfully bridges the gap between traditional thin film and bulk techniques. So! gel composite PZT layers of 5-7Om have been coated on substrates (aluminum, platinized silicon, stainless steel, .. .) that can withstand the thermal processing of the ceramic. The thickness mode response of a thin piezoelectric layer supported by a thick substrate has been modeled from first principles using complex material constants. The LevenbergMarquart non linear regression technique has been used to extract the thickness mode elastic stiffness, dielectric constant and piezoelectric constant of the PZT, and the elastic stiffness of the substrate from the layered structure. This non-destructive technique allows for a reliable assessment of the quality of a coating prior to the fabrication of a transducer. The elastic stiffness of the substrate is not lossy enough for the required broadband response of an imaging transducer. However, aluminum can be preferentially etched, releasing the ceramic coating. Therefore it is possible to transfer the PZT film to a more suitable backing material. A processing sequence for single element PZT transducers in the frequency range of 50-200MHz has been developed. Characterization of transducers has been performed using pulse-echo techniques and by creating real time B-scan images of agar phantoms and biological tissue. Methods for patterning the PZT composite coatings are being developed with the intent to fabricate a linear array in the 40-60 MHz frequency range. Due to the very fine patterning and high concentration of cuts required for a high aspect ratio linear array, the limits of conventional etching techniques are surpassed. Laser micromachining using a frequency doubled Nd:YAG and a KrF excimer laser have the ability to pattern the array structure. In both cases, laser cuts \&lt;1Om wide have been achieved.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, substantial effort has been directed toward developing ultrasonic systems for medical imaging. With advances in computational power, previously theorized scanning methods such as ultrasound tomography can now be realized. This thesis presents the design, error analysis, and initial image reconstructions from a single element 3D ultrasound tomography system. The system enables volumetric pulse echo or transmission imaging of distal limbs, for applications including: improving prosthetic fittings, monitoring bone density, and characterizing muscle health. The system is designed as a flexible mechanical platform for iterative development of algorithms targeting imaging of soft tissue with bone. The mechanical system independently controls movement of two single element ultrasound transducers in a cylindrical water tank. Each transducer can independently circle about the center of the tank as well as move vertically in depth. High resolution positioning feedback ({\textasciitilde}1[mu]m) and control enables flexible positioning of the transmitter and the receiver around the cylindrical tank; exchangeable transducers enable algorithm testing with varying transducer frequencies and beam geometries. High speed data acquisition (DAQ) through a dedicated National Instrument PXI setup streams digitized data directly to the host PC. System positioning error has been quantified and is within limits for the desired imaging modality. Imaging of various objects including: calibration objects, phantoms, bone, animal tissue, and human forearm are presented accordingly.},

We propose a system to synthesize an extended effective aperture in order to improve resolution and target detectability at depth using a precisely-tracked transducer swept across the region of interest. A Field II simulation was performed to demonstrate the swept aperture approach in both the spatial and frequency domains. The adaptively beam-formed system was tested experimentally using a volumetric transducer and an ex vivo canine abdominal layer to evaluate the impact of clutter-generating tissue on the resulting point spread function. Resolution was improved by 73\% using a 30.8 degree sweep despite the presence of varying aberration across the array with an amplitude on the order of 100 ns. Slight variations were observed in the magnitude and position of side lobes compared to the control case, but overall image quality was not significantly degraded as compared by a simulation based on the experimental point spread function. We conclude that the swept aperture imaging system may be a valuable tool for synthesizing large effective apertures using conventional ultrasound hardware. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ultrasound is emerging as an important adjunct to conventional 2D scanning, in particular in obstetrics and cardiology. Three-dimensional ultrasound makes it easier to visualize objects, pathologies and injuries. Three-dimensional ultrasound may be implemented in form of free hand scanning, which can be augmented with a registration system that records the position and orientation of each scan plane. The registration system may be in the form of an optical or EM source, mounted on the transducer, and with corresponding sensors placed in the room. In terms of portable ultrasound, free hand scanning is the most practical way to acquire 3D images. In this paper we present a new and very compact type of optical registration system, which tracks the position of the transducer on the skin surface. This is done continuously by acquiring images of the skin at the transducer location with a CCD-array, attached on the side of the transducer. With this position information, a sequence of 2D ultrasound frames, obtained with freehand scanning and thus likely to have unequal spacing and varying lateral position, is interpolated into a sequence of ultrasound frames with equal spacing and fixed lateral position. The implementation uses the Terason ultrasound scanner [1] and Sonocubic 3D software, operating in Windows XP. To validate the registration method, a phantom with a rod-shaped inclusion was scanned in an uneven scan path. Five scans were made of a known volume. The volume estimations, based on the interpolated scan planes, fell within 96-106\% of the actual volume, with a mean around 101\%. Thus, we have demonstrated that the compensation algorithm is working as expected.},

Sonographers are only available in hospitals and clinics, negating or at least delaying access to ultrasound scans in many locales—rural areas, developing countries—as well as in medical rescue operations. Telesonography would require an advanced imager that supports three-dimensional (3-D) acquisition; this would allow untrained operators to acquire broad scans and upload them remotely for diagnosis. Such advanced imagers do exist, but do not meet several other requirements for telesonography, such as being portable, inexpensive, and sufficiently low power to enable battery operation.

	doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057133},
	abstract = {Wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative, sometimes revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications that can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implantable and wearable devices. We show that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power and mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers the gap in attenuation between 2.4 GHz RF and ultrasonic waves is still substantial, e.g., ultrasounds offer 70 dB less attenuation over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires much lower transmission power compared to 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability in tissues, e.g., 35 dBm lower over 12 cm for 10$^{\textrm{-3}}$ Bit Error Rate (BEr) leading to lower energy per bit and longer device lifetime. Finally, we show experimentally that 2.4 GHz RF links are not functional at all above 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10$^{\textrm{-6}}$ up to 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.},

The method can achieve resolutions well beyond the diffraction limit, which is set by the excitation signal wavelength and numerical aperture of the imaging system. The fundamental principle that underlies this model based imaging technique is the preservation of the spatial frequency information content of the recorded echo signals with the help of pseudo-random apodization function followed by summation. A Verasonics V1 ultrasonic scanner is used to conduct experiments using an anechoic cyst made from gel phantom, immersed in degassed water. The estimated images were compared to those obtained using traditional B-mode delay-and-sum imaging available with the Verasonics V1 ultrasound machine. The estimated images using the proposed imaging technique showed a contrast ratio of 0.96 and Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of about half the wavelength at a depth of 9.1 cm and at 1.875 MHz center frequency while the traditional delay and sum images had a contrast ratio of 0.62 and FWHM of about 5.5 wavelengths.},

The validation study emulated constraints faced in evaluation of stiffness in field, such as measurement in sitting posture, use of brachial blood pressure for computations, limited time available for testing and lack of electrical power supply for instrument. The usability of the device and its accuracy, with respect to the reference ultrasound imaging system, was verified by conducting in-vivo measurements on 30 subjects. Stiffness measurements made using ARTSENS in sitting posture showed strong correlation with those obtained from the imaging system in supine posture. The repeatability of ARTSENS measurements was also found to be satisfactory.},

Direct wiring of so many elements through an endoscope is not feasible, so channel reduction should be performed locally. In this paper, we present an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that includes low-noise amplifiers, programmable-gain amplifiers and micro-beamformer circuits that locally process and combine the signals received by sub-groups of the transducer array.

Micro-ultrasound is one of these tools and is second after whole-mouse fluorescence or bioluminescent imaging, in terms of installed systems. We report in this paper the first commercially available array transducer–based ultrasound imaging system that enables micro-ultrasound imaging at center frequencies between 15 and 50MHz. At the heart of the new scanner is a laser-machined high-frequency 256 element, linear transducer array capable of forming dynamic diffraction limited beams. The power of the linear array approach is embodied in the uniform high resolution maintained over the full field of view. This leads to greatly expanded scope for real-time functional imaging that is demonstrated in this paper. The unprecedented images made with the new imaging system will enable many new applications not previously possible. These include real-time visualization of flow in the mouse placenta, visualization of flow development in the embryo, studies of embryonic to adult cardiac development/disease, and studies of real-time blood flow in mouse models of tumour angiogenesis.

	abstract = {The lack of open access to the pre-beamformed data of an ultrasound scanner has limited the research of novel imaging methods to a few privileged laboratories. To address this need, we have developed a pre-beamformed data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data over 128 array elements in parallel from the Ultrasonix series of research-purpose ultrasound scanners. Our DAQ system comprises three system-level blocks: 1) a connector board that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner through a probe connector port; 2) a main board that triggers DAQ and controls data transfer to a computer; and 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board memory. This system can acquire pre-beamformed data with 12-bit resolution when using a 40-MHz sampling rate. It houses a 16 GB RAM buffer that is sufficient to store 128 channels of pre-beamformed data for 8000 to 25000 transmit firings, depending on imaging depth; corresponding to nearly a 2-s period in typical imaging setups. Following the acquisition, the data can be transferred through a USB 2.0 link to a computer for offline processing and analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of using the DAQ system for advanced imaging research, two proof-of-concept investigations have been conducted on beamforming and plane-wave B-flow imaging. Results show that adaptive beamforming algorithms such as the minimum variance approach can generate sharper images of a wire cross-section whose diameter is equal to the imaging wavelength (150 μm in our example). Also, plane wave B-flow imaging can provide more consistent visualization of blood speckle movement given the higher temporal resolution of this imaging approach (2500 fps in our example).},

	abstract = {In order to improve the lateral resolution and extend the field of view of a previously reported 48 element 30MHz ultrasound linear array and 16-channel digital imaging system, the development of a 256 element 30MHz linear array and an ultrasound imaging system with increased channel count has been undertaken. This paper reports the design and testing of a 64 channel digital imaging system which consists of an analog front-end pulser/receiver, 64 channels of Time-Gain Compensation (TGC), 64 channels of high-speed digitizer as well as a beamformer. A Personal Computer (PC) is used as the user interface to display real-time images. This system is designed as a platform for the purpose of testing the performance of high frequency linear arrays that have been developed in house. Therefore conventional approaches were taken it its implementation. Flexibility and ease of use are of primary concern whereas consideration of cost-effectiveness and novelty in design are only secondary. Even so, there are many issues at higher frequencies but do not exist at lower frequencies need to be solved. The system provides 64 channels of excitation pulsers while receiving simultaneously at a 20–120MHz sampling rate to 12-bits. The digitized data from all channels are first fed through Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and then stored in memories. These raw data are accessed by the beamforming processor to re-build the image or to be downloaded to the PC for further processing. The beamformer that applies delays to the echoes of each channel is implemented with the strategy that combines coarse (8.3ns) and fine delays (2ns). The coarse delays are integer multiples of the sampling clock rate and are achieved by controlling the write enable pin of the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory to obtain valid beamforming data. The fine delays are accomplished with interpolation filters. This system is capable of achieving a maximum frame rate of 50 frames per second. Wire phantom images acquired with this system show a spatial resolution of 146μm (lateral) and 54μm (axial). Images with excised rabbit and pig eyeball as well as mouse embryo were also acquired to demonstrate its imaging capability.},

	abstract = {A comparative study of two methods used for dynamic focusing of ultrasound: the conventional phased arrays and a new method based on time reversal of acoustic signals is carried out. A laboratory model of the focusing system based on time reversal is developed and manufactured. One of the principal elements of the system is a reverberator with several piezoelectric transducers attached to its walls. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the ability of such a system to generate one focus or several foci and to steer them electronically at considerable distances (50 mm at minimum) off the axis of the focusing system without causing the appearance of any grating lobes or other secondary intensity maxima. The focusing properties of the system are compared with the results of numerical simulation of two-dimensional phased arrays, whose parameters are taken to be typical for the arrays used in extracorporeal surgery. The important role of randomization is demonstrated for both of the aforementioned focusing methods. The prospects of practical application of the two methods are discussed.},

	url = {http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/14035},
	abstract = {Long Range Ultrasonic Testing (LRUT) is an emerging ultrasound Non-destructive Testing (NDT) method. The LRUT is a variant of the conventional NDT approach. By using ultrasound guided waves (UGWs) , it is efficient in quick long range defect scanning, which is impossible with other traditional NDT techniques. Increasing numbers of requirements for quick long range testing have led to urgent need for the improvement of testing methods and the development of new testing equipment to help researchers in laboratory and help technicians in  field inspection. The market for multi-channel ultrasonic instruments is characterized by small volumes of sales and a high ratio of development costs to sale price. The consequence is that the investment required to develop an instrument is significant and upgrades and other changes to instrument specification or configuration are difficult for many manufacturers to justify. These factors are particularly relevant for long range guided wave technology, where the technology is still relatively new in the market place and the instrumentation has different characteristics from other type of ultrasonic systems. In order to support the design and manufacture of the Teletest®MK4 system, Plant Integrity Ltd has supported this study into the use of a  field-programmable gates array (FPGA) based control circuits for the electronics, which allows the component count to be decreased and also permits the system to be modified via flexible reconfiguration of the FPGA. This has benefits of reduction of size, weight and power consumption of the electronics and provides a means of upgrading the product without expensive re-design of the hardware. FPGA device has been the enabling technology and main thrust behind the evolution of many technologies, unleashing new opportunities for improving the performance of the LRUT equipment and providing more functions for industrial and academic applications. A novel system has been developed to provide multichannel waveform generation, data capture and signal processing for advanced lab-based research and faster- field testing. This system includes an FPGA to process multichannel data in parallel and to provide the flexibility of reconfiguration for various testing applications proposed by new research. The design was tested in pre-prototype hardware. Subsequent construction of the commercial prototype unit enabled successful operation of the design to be demonstrated. Implementation of the FPGA design reduced component count, PCB dimensions and power consumption. Though the SpartanTM 3A DSP FPGA and Xilinx ISE software have been used in this project, the concepts of the design can be applied to other FPGA devices from other FPGA vendors using other design softwares.},

However, most implementations developed to take advantage of this framework revolve around controlling the measurements with carefully engineered material or acquisition sequences. Instead, we use the natural randomness of wave propagation through multiply scattering media as an optimal and instantaneous compressive imaging mechanism. Waves reflected from an object are detected after propagation through a well-characterized complex medium. Each local measurement thus contains global information about the object, yielding a purely analog compressive sensing method. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optical imaging by using a 300-micrometer thick layer of white paint as the compressive imaging device. Scattering media are thus promising candidates for designing efficient and compact compressive imagers.},

Thousands of transducers are typically needed for focusing and steering in a 3-D volume. In this article, we propose a different concept allowing us to obtain electronic 3-D focusing with a small number of transducers. The basic idea is to couple a small number of transducers to a chaotic reverberating cavity with one face in contact with the body of the patient. The reverberations of the ultrasonic waves inside the cavity create at each reflection virtual transducers. The cavity acts as an ultrasonic kaleidoscope multiplying the small number of transducers and creating a much larger virtual transducer array. By exploiting time-reversal processing, it is possible to use collectively all the virtual transducers to focus a pulse everywhere in a 3-D volume. The reception process is based on a nonlinear pulse-inversion technique in order to ensure a good contrast. The feasibility of this concept for the building of 3-D images was demonstrated using a prototype relying only 31 emission transducers and a single reception transducer.},

Greedy algorithms have been found to be more suitable in hardware solutions, however they rely on efficient matrix inversion techniques in order to solve the underdetermined linear systems involved. In this paper, a novel and efficient FPGA architecture to find a matrix inversion is presented.

The received data can be accessed as single element channel data and transferred to a PC via Gigabit Ethernet or PCI-Express where beamforming can be done on a graphics processor (GPU). Powerful online and offline software packages including unique filtering interfaces and closed-loop control are available to process, analyze and visualize the data.

METHODS: B-scan images produced using two transducers, one with a narrow bandwidth and the other with a broad bandwidth, both having nominal center frequencies of 10 MHz, were evaluated. Comparative scans were made of a tissue-mimicking phantom, an intraocular tumor, and a vitreous hemorrhage.
RESULTS: Results showed that broadband transducers gave improved resolution and finer speckle texture, but had lower sensitivity. Broadband transducers were most suitable for situations in which resolution was more important than sensitivity, such as imaging of tumors. The greater sensitivity of the narrowband probe made it most useful for evaluation of vitreous complications, such as hemorrhage and membranes.
CONCLUSION: In addition to transducer frequency, bandwidth should be taken into account when choosing a transducer for a specific ophthalmic imaging application. Both broad- and narrowband transducers have relative advantages in particular applications.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Commercial ultrasound machines in the past did not provide the ultrasound researchers access to raw ultrasound data. Lack of this ability has impeded evaluation and clinical testing of novel ultrasound algorithms and applications.
OBJECTIVES: Recently, we developed a flexible ultrasound back-end where all the processing for the conventional ultrasound modes, such as B, M, color flow and spectral Doppler, was performed in software. The back-end has been incorporated into a commercial ultrasound machine, the Hitachi HiVision 5500. The goal of this work is to develop an ultrasound research interface on the back-end for acquiring raw ultrasound data from the machine.
METHODS: The research interface has been designed as a software module on the ultrasound back-end. To increase the amount of raw ultrasound data that can be spooled in the limited memory available on the back-end, we have developed a method that can losslessly compress the ultrasound data in real time.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The raw ultrasound data could be obtained in any conventional ultrasound mode, including duplex and triplex modes. Furthermore, use of the research interface does not decrease the frame rate or otherwise affect the clinical usability of the machine. The lossless compression of the ultrasound data in real time can increase the amount of data spooled by approximately 2.3 times, thus allowing more than 6s of raw ultrasound data to be acquired in all the modes. The interface has been used not only for early testing of new ideas with in vitro data from phantoms, but also for acquiring in vivo data for fine-tuning ultrasound applications and conducting clinical studies. We present several examples of how newer ultrasound applications, such as elastography, vibration imaging and 3D imaging, have benefited from this research interface. Since the research interface is entirely implemented in software, it can be deployed on existing HiVision 5500 ultrasound machines and may be easily upgraded in the future.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed research interface can aid researchers in the rapid testing and clinical evaluation of new ultrasound algorithms and applications. Additionally, we believe that our approach would be applicable to designing research interfaces on other ultrasound machines.},

This paper presents the development of a real-time compact and open system for customized ultrasound bio-microscope studies. The system design was based on high speed FPGA embedded in compact printed circuit board (PCB) to achieve B-mode imaging and pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler imaging. Instead of hardware circuitries, most of functions were achieved with FPGA programs such as filter, envelope detector, digital scan converter (DSC), and complex fast Fourier transform (CFFT). The system structure could easily be modified by the user for customized applications. Testing results showed that the system could offer a minimum detectable signal of 25μV, allowing a 51dB dynamic range at 47dB gain. PCI interface included in the system allowed fast radio frequency (RF) data transfer and real-time imaging (over 500 frames per second).

Ultrasound scanning have the capability to image the organs in real time, thus offering quick diagnosis. Recent advancements in computing platforms greatly reduced the size of an ultrasound machine to portable level. Portable ultrasound machines can be used for point of care and remote diagnosis, this comforts the patients by making them not going to the ultrasound scanner for diagnosis. Diagnosing the patients at their bedside reduces the diagnosis and medication time. Lack of sonographers limits the benefits of using portable ultrasound machines in remote diagnosis. Tele-radiology can be effectively used as a solution to provide better health-care to more number of patients with less number of experts. Portable ultrasound in remote diagnosis is concerned with wireless connectivity for web-based diagnosis, security, data aggregation of patients etc., In this paper, we propose a working prototype of portable ultrasound scanning system integrated with wireless connectivity, biometric authentication, Global Positioning System (GPS). Additional interfaces to the portable ultrasound system enables secured cloud based diagnosis, improving the health-care and reducing the geographical separation between patients and doctors.},

The backend processing consists of envelope detection which uses fixed filter coefficients for Hilbert transformation, log compression technique to achieve the desired dynamic range for display and image enhancement technique to increase the contrast. In-phase and quadrature phase components are computed using envelope detection block, whose absolute value is compressed to fit the dynamic range of display and interpolated to avoid artifacts while displaying. Further full scale contrast stretch enhancement technique is used to improve the image clarity. The implementation of the backend algorithms along with image enhancement technique on FPGA, show that the resolution of display is improved and also the hardware resource utilization is minimized leading to compact design for portable ultrasound systems.},

	abstract = {Received echo signals of transducer in ultrasound imaging have a high dynamic range of 12 bits and hence cannot be displayed on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors of ultrasound machine. Log compression is being used to compress the data to 8 bits. Since log compression is a non linear compression it is very difficult to trace the original characteristics of the signal. In this paper various global and local compression techniques were studied as a replacement for log compression so that the dynamic range of image can be retrieved if the physician has a better monitor for display, and also ensure minimum error in the retrieved signal leading to minimum error in retrieved image. From the results it is observed that Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of wavelet compressed image is 1.02 times more and that of gamma compressed image is 2.24 times more than log compressed image. Gamma based compression can be preferred to log and wavelet based compression, as it gives good quality image when compared with other compression techniques, but cannot be used to retrieve the statistical properties when expanded, since these statistical properties are helpful for doctors for better analysis. Wavelet based compression serves this purpose and hence is best suited for Internet of Things (IoT) enabled ultrasound system for remote diagnosis in the cloud.},

	abstract = {Open platform (OP) ultrasound systems are aimed primarily at the research community. They have been at the forefront of the development of synthetic aperture, plane wave, shear wave elastography, and vector flow imaging. Such platforms are driven by a need for broad flexibility of parameters that are normally preset or fixed within clinical scanners. OP ultrasound scanners are defined to have three key features including customization of the transmit waveform, access to the prebeamformed receive data, and the ability to implement real-time imaging. In this paper, a formative discussion is given on the development of OPs from both the research community and the commercial sector. Both software- and hardware-based architectures are considered, and their specifications are compared in terms of resources and programmability. Software-based platforms capable of real-time beamforming generally make use of scalable graphics processing unit architectures, whereas a common feature of hardware-based platforms is the use of field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor devices to provide additional on-board processing capacity. OPs with extended number of channels ({\textgreater}256) are also discussed in relation to their role in supporting 3-D imaging technique development. With the increasing maturity of OP ultrasound scanners, the pace of advancement in ultrasound imaging algorithms is poised to be accelerated.},

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.165},
	abstract = {Synthetic aperture (SA) ultrasound imaging has many advantages in terms of flexibility and accuracy. One of the major drawbacks is, however, that no system exists, which can implement SA imaging in real time due to the very high number of calculations amounting to roughly 1 billion complex focused samples per second per receive channel. Real time imaging is a key aspect in ultrasound, and to truly demonstrate the many advantages of SA imaging, a system usable in the clinic should be made. The paper describes a system capable of real time SA B-mode and vector flow imaging. The synthetic aperture real-time ultrasound system (SARUS) has been developed through the last 2 years and can perform real time SA imaging and storage of RF channel data for multiple seconds. SARUS consists of a 1024 channel analog front-end and 64 identical digital boards. Each has 16 transmit channels and 16 receive channels both with a sampling frequency of 70 MHz/12 bits for arbitrary waveform emission and reception. The board holds live Virtex 4FX100 FPGAs, where one houses a PowerPC CPU used for control. The remaining four are used for generation of transmit signals, receive storage and matched Alter processing, and focusing and summing of data. Each FPGA can perform 80 billion multiplications/s and the full system can perform 25,600 billion multiplications/s. The FPGAs are connected through multiple 3.2 Gbit Rocket IO links, which makes it possible to send more than 1.6 GBytes/s of data between the FPGAs and between boards. The system can concurrently sample in 1024 channels, thus, generating 140 GBytes/s of data, which also can be processed in real time or stored. The system is controlled over a 1 Gbit/s Ethernet link to each digital board that runs Linux. The control and processing are divided into functional units that are accessed through an IP numbering scheme in a hierarchical order. A single controlling mechanism can, thus, be used to access the whole system from any PC. It is also p-
ossible for the controlling PowerPCs to access all other boards, which enables advanced adaptive imaging. The software is written in C++ and runs under Matlab for high level access to the system in a command structure similar to the Field II simulation program. This makes it possible for the user to specify imaging in very few lines of code and the set-up is fast due to the employment of the 64 PowerPCs in parallel. Focusing is done using a parametric beam former. Code synthesized for a Xilinx V4FX100 speed grade 11 FPGA can operate at a maximum clock frequency of 167.8 MHz producing 1 billion I and Q samples/second sufficient for real time SA imaging. The system is currently in production, and all boards have been laid out. VHDL and C++ code for the control has been written and the code for real time beamformation has been made and has obtained a sufficient performance for real-time imaging.},

	abstract = {Digital signal processing is being employed more and more in modern ultrasound scanners. This has made it possible to do dynamic receive focusing for each sample and implement other advanced imaging methods. The processing, however, has to be very fast and cost-effective at the same time. Dedicated chips are used in order to do real time processing. This often makes it difficult to implement radically different imaging strategies on one platform and makes the scanners less accessible for research purposes. Here flexibility is the prime concern, and the storage of data from all transducer elements over 5 to 10 seconds is needed to perform clinical evaluation of synthetic and 3D imaging. This paper describes a real-time system specifically designed for research purposes. The purpose of the system is to make it possible to acquire multi-channel data in real-time from clinical multi-element ultrasound transducers, and to enable real-time or near real-time processing of the acquired data. The system will be capable of performing the processing for the currently available imaging methods, and will make it possible to perform initial trials in a clinical environment with new imaging modalities for synthetic aperture imaging, 2D and 3D B-mode and velocity imaging. The system can be used with 128 element transducers and can excite 128 channels and receive and sample data from 64 channels simultaneously at 40 MHz with 12 bits precision. Data can be processed in real time using the system's 80 signal processing units or it can be stored directly in RAM. The system has 24 GBytes RAM and can thus store 8 seconds of multi-channel data. It is fully software programmable and its signal processing units can also be reconfigured under software control. The control of the system is done over an Ethernet using C and Matlab. Programs for doing, e.g. B-mode imaging can directly be written in Matlab and executed on the system over the net from any workstation running Matlab. The overall system concept is presented and an example of a 20 lines script for doing phased array B-mode imaging is presented},

	abstract = {Clinical endoscopy and colonoscopy are commonly used to investigate and diagnose disorders in the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon respectively. However, examination of the anatomically remote small bowel with conventional endoscopy is challenging. This and advances in miniaturization led to the development of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) to allow small bowel examination in a non-invasive manner. Available since 2001, current capsule endoscopes are limited to viewing the mucosal surface only due to their reliance on optical imaging. To overcome this limitation with submucosal imaging, work is under way to implement microultrasound (μUS) imaging in the same form as VCE devices. This paper describes two prototype capsules, termed Sonocap and Thermocap, which were developed respectively to assess the quality of μUS imaging and the maximum power consumption that can be tolerated for such a system. The capsules were tested in vivo in the oesophagus and small bowel of porcine models. Results are presented in the form of μUS B-scans and safe temperature readings observed up to 100 mW in both biological regions. These results demonstrate that acoustic coupling and μUS imaging can be achieved in vivo in the lumen of the bowel and the maximum power consumption that is possible for miniature μUS systems.},

Utilizing the previously-developed efficient front-end algorithms and the continuing advances in solid state devices, we developed a hybrid programmable architecture to support core ultrasound signal processing. With the advent of new- generation digital signal processors (DSPs) (e.g., Texas Instruments' TMS320C6455 and IBM's Cell Broadband Engine), this hybrid field programmable gate array (FPGA)- DSP architecture can evolve towards a single-chip solution after overcoming the following challenges: (a) inefficient data access during dynamic focusing and (b) multiple, parallel data- transfer paths from ADCs. In this paper, we present a new single-DSP architecture, where an advanced DSP handles all the front- and back-end processing in software. To enable this new architecture, we have (a) developed a new stepwise dynamic focusing method, where the same delay curve is utilized for a group of samples along the depth direction and (b) investigated use of serial interfaces for ADC to DSP data transfer. It was found that the TMS320C6455 can meet the requirements of a 32-channel B-mode imaging system using 56.6\% and 85.4\% of the computing and serial I/O resources of the DSP, respectively. These results indicate that a single DSP chip solution can meet the hardware requirements for lower-end medical ultrasound systems.},

The receiver part has integrated circuits that include low noise amplifier, automatic gain control, time gain compensation, anti-aliasing filter and analog to digital convertor and processed in two different FPGA.

	abstract = {A wide variety of beamforming approaches are applied in modern ultrasound scanners, ranging from optimal time domain beamforming strategies at one end to rudimentary narrowband schemes at the other. Although significant research has been devoted to improving image quality, usually at the expense of beamformer complexity, we are interested in investigating strategies that sacrifice some image quality in exchange for reduced cost and ease in implementation. This paper describes the direct sampled in-phase/quadrature (DSIQ) beamformer, which is one such low-cost, extremely simple, and compact approach. DSIQ beamforming relies on phase rotation of I/Q data to implement focusing. The I/Q data are generated by directly sampling the received radio frequency (RF) signal, rather than through conventional demodulation. We describe an efficient hardware implementation of the beam-former, which results in significant reductions in beam-former size and cost. We present the results of simulations and experiments that compare the DSIQ beamformer to more conventional approaches, namely, time delay beamforming and traditional complex demodulated I/Q beam-forming. Results that show the effect of an error in the direct sampling process, as well as dependence on signal bandwidth and system f number (f\#) are also presented. These results indicate that the image quality and robustness of the DSIQ beamformer are adequate for low end scanners. We also describe implementation of the DSIQ beamformer in an inexpensive hand-held ultrasound system being developed in our laboratory.},

	abstract = {Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and intracardiac echography (ICE) catheters with real-time volumetric ultrasound imaging capability can provide unique benefits to many interventional procedures used in the diagnosis and treatment of coronary and structural heart diseases. Integration of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays with front-end electronics in single-chip configuration allows for implementation of such catheter probes with reduced interconnect complexity, miniaturization, and high mechanical flexibility. We implemented a single-chip forward-looking (FL) ultrasound imaging system by fabricating a 1.4-mm-diameter dual-ring CMUT array using CMUT-on-CMOS technology on a front-end IC implemented in 0.35-μm CMOS process. The dual-ring array has 56 transmit elements and 48 receive elements on two separate concentric annular rings. The IC incorporates a 25-V pulser for each transmitter and a low-noise capacitive transimpedance amplifier (TIA) for each receiver, along with digital control and smart power management. The final shape of the silicon chip is a 1.5-mm-diameter donut with a 430-μm center hole for a guide wire. The overall front-end system requires only 13 external connections and provides 4 parallel RF outputs while consuming an average power of 20 mW. We measured RF A-scans from the integrated single- chip array which show full functionality at 20.1 MHz with 43\% fractional bandwidth. We also tested and demonstrated the image quality of the system on a wire phantom and an ex vivo chicken heart sample. The measured axial and lateral point resolutions are 92 μm and 251 μm, respectively. We successfully acquired volumetric imaging data from the ex vivo chicken heart at 60 frames per second without any signal averaging. These demonstrative results indicate that single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS systems have the potential to produce realtime volumetric images with image- quality and speed suitable for catheter-based clinical applications.},

With its better image quality and ease of use, ICE is becoming the preferred imaging modality over transesophageal echography (TEE) for structural heart interventions. The existing commercial ICE catheters, however, offer a limited 2-D or 3-D field of view despite catheters utilizing large number of wires. In these catheters, each element in the ICE array is connected to the backend data-acquisition channel with a separate wire, which is a critical barrier for improving image quality and widening the field of view. In order to use ICE catheters under MRI instead of the ionizing X-ray radiation-based angiography, the number of interconnect wires in the catheter should be minimized to reduce RF-induced heating. Furthermore, reducing the number of wires improves the flexibility and lowers the cost of the single-use ICE catheters.},

The proposed method is first demonstrated using a pitch-catch configuration using a separate source transducer to excite the transducer under test. Subsequently the method is demonstrated the Ultrasound Array Research Platform (UARP) and a linear array transducer in a pulse echo mode where the transducer impedance is determined through the analysis of two ultrasound echoes. The proposed method is especially suited to rapid transducer testing in the field, such as in a hospital, or where access to the transducer is not possible as in many industrial processes.},

However, the computer software that helps design and execute experiments and analyze data has an additional source: It can also be free and open-source software (FOSS) (1). FOSS has the advantage that the code is openly available for modification and is also often free of charge. In the past, customizing software has been much easier than custom-building equipment, which often can be quite costly because fabrication requires the skills of machinists, glassblowers, technicians, or outside suppliers. However, the open-source paradigm is now enabling creation of open-source scientific hardware by combining three-dimensional (3D) printing with open-source microcontrollers running on FOSS. These developments are illustrated below by several examples of equipment fabrication that can better meet particular specifications at substantially lower overall costs.
A rapidly increasing selection of laboratory equipment can be fabricated with open-source three-dimensional printers at low cost.

Development of microbubble contrast agents over the past several decades has enabled ultrasound to distinguish between blood flow and surrounding tissue. Current clinical practices using microbubble contrast agents rely heavily on user training to evaluate degree of localized perfusion. Advances in separating the signals produced from contrast agents versus surrounding tissue backscatter provide unique opportunities for specialized sensors designed to image microbubbles with higher signal to noise and resolution than previously possible. In this review article, we describe the background principles and recent developments of ultrasound transducer technology for receiving signals produced by contrast agents while rejecting signals arising from soft tissue. This approach relies on transmitting at a  low-frequency and receiving microbubble harmonic signals at frequencies many times higher than the transmitted frequency. Design and fabrication of dual-frequency transducers and the extension of recent developments in transducer technology for dual-frequency harmonic imaging are discussed.},

In this paper, we present three significant extensions to improve the performance of the basic method. First, we investigate the effect of varying the size and shape of the sticks. We show that these variations affect the performance of the algorithm in very fundamental ways, for example by making it more or less sensitive to thinner or more tightly curving boundaries. Second, we present a means of improving the performance of this technique by estimating the distribution function of the orientation of the line passing through each point. Finally, we show that images can be "stained" for easier visual interpretation by applying to each pixel a false color whose hue is related to the orientation of the most prominent line segment at that point. Examples are given to illustrate the performance of the different settings on a single image.},

We hypothesize that, by collecting synthetic aperture data sets over a range of aperture positions while precisely tracking the position and orientation of the transducer, we can synthesize large effective apertures to produce images with improved resolution and target detectability. We analyze the two largest limiting factors for coherent signal summation: aberration and mechanical uncertainty. Using an excised canine abdominal wall as a model phase screen, we experimentally observed an effective arrival time error ranging from 18.3 ns to 58 ns (root-mean-square error) across the swept positions. Through this clutter-generating tissue, we observed a 72.9\% improvement in resolution with only a 3.75 dB increase in side lobe amplitude compared to the control case. We present a simulation model to study the effect of calibration and mechanical jitter errors on the synthesized point spread function. The relative effects of these errors in each imaging dimension are explored, showing the importance of orientation relative to the point spread function. We present a prototype device for performing swept synthetic aperture imaging using a conventional 1-D array transducer and ultrasound research scanner. Point target reconstruction error for a 44.2 degree sweep shows a reconstruction precision of 82.8 and 17.8 in the lateral and axial dimensions respectively, within the acceptable performance bounds of the simulation model. Improvements in resolution, contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio are demonstrated in vivo and in a fetal phantom.},

	abstract = {Objective: In this paper, we present the design of low-cost medical ultrasound scanners aimed at the detection of maternal mortality risk factors in developing countries. Method: Modern ultrasound scanners typically employ a high element count transducer array with multichannel transmit and receive electronics. To minimize hardware costs, we employ a single piezoelectric element, mechanically swept across the target scene, and a highly cost-engineered single channel acquisition circuit. Given this constraint, we compare the achievable image quality of a monostatic fixed focus scanner (MFFS) with a monostatic synthetic aperture scanner (MSAS) using postfocusing. Quantitative analysis of image quality was carried out using simulation and phantom experiments, which were used to compare a proof-of-concept MSAS prototype with an MFFS device currently available on the market. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to validate the MSAS prototype in obstetric imaging. Results: Simulations show that the achievable lateral resolution of the MSAS approach is superior at all ranges compared to the fixed focus approach. Phantom experiments verify the improved resolution of the MSAS prototype but reveal a lower signal to noise ratio. In vivo experiments show promising results using the MSAS for clinical diagnostics in prenatal care. Conclusion: The proposed MSAS achieves superior resolution but lower SNR compared to an MFFS approach, principally due to lower acoustic energy emitted. Significance : The production costs of the proposed MSAS could be an order of magnitude lower than any other ultrasound system on the market today, bringing affordable obstetric imaging a step closer for developing countries.},

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0233},
	abstract = {In ultrasound medical imaging, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement can be achieved by utilizing the code excitation. To preserve the axial resolution, a pulse compression (PC) is performed by applying a matched filter based on the transmit code. However, the conventional PC method requires a few hundred filter coefficients when compressing elongated code (e.g., chirp) into a short pulse, yielding to considerably high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient PC method of chirp coded excitation is proposed to lower the complexity burden. In the proposed method, the PC is conducted with the decimated complex baseband data instead of a beamformed radio-frequency (RF) data. Although compression is applied with the complex data, a total computational complexity is reduced by a factor of 4 L2 since L-fold decimation is performed to reduce both data and the number of filter coefficients. The proposed method was evaluated with the phantom study. For quantitative comparison, the -6dB axial resolution for 15 wire targets and the clutter-energy-to-total-energy ratios (CTRs) at a hypo-echoic region were measured. CTR were 27.6 dB and 27.4 dB for the conventional and proposed PC methods, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method can maintain the performance of pulse compression of chirp coded excitation while substantially reducing computational complexity.},

In this paper, we propose a new dynamic CBB PC method ( that can improve the SNR while compensating for tissue attenuation. The compression filter coefficients in the method are generated by dynamically changing the demodulation frequencies along with the depth. For PC, the obtained coefficients are independently applied to the in-phase and quadrature components of the CBB data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulation, phantom, and in vivo studies were conducted, and all three studies showed improved SNR, i.e., maximally 3.87, 7.41, and 5.75 dB, respectively. In addition, the measured peak range sidelobe level of the proposed method yielded lower values than the and , and it also derived a suitable target location, i.e., a {\textless}0.07-mm target location error, while maintaining the axial resolution. In an in vivo abdominal experiment, the method depicted brighter and clearer features in the hyperechoic region because highly correlated signals were produced by compensating for tissue attenuation. These results demonstrated that the proposed method can improve the SNR of chirp-coded excitation while preserving the axial resolution and the target location and reducing the computational complexity.},

Second, most pipelines are implemented in special hardware, resulting in limited flexibility of implemented processing steps on such platforms. Methods: With SUPRA we propose an open-source pipeline for fully Software Defined Ultrasound Processing for Real-time Applications to alleviate these problems. Covering all steps from beamforming to output of B-mode images, SUPRA can help improve the reproducibility of results and make modifications to the image acquisition mode accessible to the research community. We evaluate the pipeline qualitatively, quantitatively, and regarding its run-time. Results: The pipeline shows image quality comparable to a clinical system and backed by point-spread function measurements a comparable resolution. Including all processing stages of a usual ultrasound pipeline, the run-time analysis shows that it can be executed in 2D and 3D on consumer GPUs in real-time. Conclusions: Our software ultrasound pipeline opens up the research in image acquisition. Given access to ultrasound data from early stages (raw channel data, radiofrequency data) it simplifies the development in imaging. Furthermore, it tackles the reproducibility of research results, as code can be shared easily and even be executed without dedicated ultrasound hardware.},

	abstract = {The current work investigates the performance of a real-time scan conversion algorithm for generating a 2-D ultrasound image from a laterally scanned single-element ultrasound transducer, which has applications in point-of-care devices such as for skin imaging. The algorithm employs a fixed calibration curve to update a predefined image grid in real time. Simulations showed that the calibration curve (with a maximum of 1) is robust to changes in scatterer concentration (8.3×10-3 mean absolute error), signal to noise ratio (1.0×10-3 mean absolute error for −5 dB SNR), and can be accurately predicted from a small number (31) of point scatterers (6.9×10-3 mean absolute error). Good agreement was also found between the calibration curves obtained from simulated and experimental data (1.19×10-2 mean absolute error). The scan conversion algorithm was validated by evaluation of the position estimation errors on both simulations and experiments. Clinical images of skin lesions (N = 20) demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm for real, non-homogeneous tissue. Use of a fixed calibration curve compared to an adaptive calibration curve gave similar accuracies in the scanning step size range of 150–350 μm (with an average overlap of the accuracy ranges of 92.94\% for simulations and 42.83\% for experiments), and a 350-fold improvement in computation time.},

Tomato paste and gravy appeared to be cleaned by mechanical forces whereas malt extract dissolved into the cleaning water.

To explore the specimens, regardless of their orientation and shape, a scanned area of the test sample was defined using shape recognition applying optical background subtraction to the images captured by a camera. The motorized platform was validated using seven phantom tissues, simulating the mechanical and acoustical properties of ex-vivo diseased tissues, including stiffer nodules that can be encountered in pathological conditions during histological analyses. Results demonstrated the platform\&rsquo;s ability to automatically explore and identify the inclusions in the phantom. Overall, the system was able to correctly identify up to 90.3\% of the inclusions by means of stiffness in combination with ultrasound measurements, paving pathways towards robotic palpation during intraoperative examinations.},

	abstract = {Bone mineral density is an important parameter for the diagnosis of bone diseases, as well as for predicting fractures and treatment monitoring. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) to monitor bone changes after calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium loss in rat femurs in vitro during a demineralization process. Four quantitative ultrasound parameters were estimated from bone surface echoes in eight femur diaphysis of rats. The echo signals were acquired during a decalcification process by Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA). The results were compared to Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry measurements for validation. Integrated Reflection Coefficient (IRC) reflection parameters and Frequency Slope of Reflection Transfer Function (FSRTF) during demineralization tended to decrease, while the backscattering parameter Apparent Integrated Backscatter (AIB) increased and Frequency Slope of Apparent Backscatter (FSAB) showed an oscillatory behavior with no defined trend. Results indicate a clear relation between demineralization and the corresponding decrease in the reflection parameters and increase in the scattering parameters. The trend analysis of the fall curve of the chemical elements showed a better relationship between IRC and QCT. It was possible to monitor bone changes after ions losses, through the QUS. Thus, it is an indication that the proposed protocol has potential to characterize bone tissue in animal models, providing consistent results towards standardization of bone characterization studies by QUS endorsing its use in humans.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is the current state-of-the-art imaging tool for monitoring cavitation activity during focused ultrasound therapy such as blood-brain barrier opening. However, PAM incurs huge computational complexity. To address this issue, frequency-domain PAM (FD-PAM) was proposed. Nevertheless, FD-PAM still requires a large number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) to produce the frequency components utilized for cavitation monitoring with PAM. Hence, in this paper, we proposes a frequency domain PAM method using passive Hilbert beamforming (PHB-PAM), which can significantly reduce the number of input samples for FFT by down-sampling the analytic signal of the received RF samples at each channel at a rate equal to the bandwidth of the frequency components of interest. The experimental results show that the proposed PHB-PAM provides comparable image quality to that of FD-PAM (correlation coefficient {\textgreater} 0.98). Additionally, the study experimentally verifies that the pre-processing block for generating the decimated analytic signal and FFT in PHB-PAM can be realized using lesser logic resources than FFT in FD-PAM when implemented in an FPGA. Especially, with 128-fold decimation, PHB-PAM reduces the amount of LUTs and DSP slices to implement the pre-processing block by 72.16 \% and 53.4 \%, respectively, compared to those of FD-PAM, which allows the 64-channel implementation of the pre-processing block in a low-cost single FPGA. Finally, a hardware-efficient architecture for the pre-processing block of PHB-PAM is described, which can be implemented by replacing the two lowpass filters of an off-the-shelf analog front-end component for ultrasound imaging with a pair of band-pass filters. If PHB-PAM is realized using such a component, it can truly minimize the computational complexity of FD-PAM.},

	abstract = {Limitations on bandwidth and power consumption impose strict bounds on data rates of diagnostic imaging systems. Consequently, the design of suitable (i.e. task- and data-aware) compression and reconstruction techniques has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Compressed sensing emerged as a popular framework for sparse signal reconstruction from a small set of compressed measurements. However, typical compressed sensing designs measure a (non)linearly weighted combination of all input signal elements, which poses practical challenges. These designs are also not necessarily task-optimal. In addition, real-time recovery is hampered by the iterative and time-consuming nature of sparse recovery algorithms. Recently, deep learning methods have shown promise for fast recovery from compressed measurements, but the design of adequate and practical sensing strategies remains a challenge. Here, we propose a deep learning solution, termed LASSY (LeArning Sub-Sampling and recoverY), that jointly learns a task-driven sub-sampling pattern and subsequent reconstruction model. The learned sub-sampling patterns are straightforwardly implementable, and based on the task at hand. LASSY's effectiveness is demonstrated in-silico for sparse signal recovery from partial Fourier measurements, and in-vivo for both anatomical-image and motion (Doppler) reconstruction from sub-sampled medical ultrasound imaging data.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging, in the A-SCAN data processing, consumes a lot of resources and takes a long time. It is difficult to achieve real-time imaging requirements. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) show advantages such as fast processing speed and strong parallelism for the ultrasonic synthetic aperture imaging platform. It provides a viable solution for real-time imaging. In this article, a new ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging structure is introduced, which reduces the resource consumption and improves the imaging efficiency. In this structure, the ultrasound imaging initialization structure is configured, and the index value is configured in the RAM using a memory initialization file, which reduces the square, extraction of a root and other operations in the hardware structure, and reduces the delay operation in the hardware structure. The symmetric relation exists between the index values of symmetric elements, the index values are reused to reduce the memory requirement. Perform functional descriptions using hardware description languages and perform performance tests on Altera Stratix IV FPGAs. According to 32-channel synthetic aperture imaging experiment, the use of index values for beamformer design improves the imaging efficiency and reduces the consumption of hardware resources under the premise of ensuring the ultrasound image and contrast.},

	url = {https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0320796},
	abstract = {The goal of this thesis is to explore the potential of using ultrasound as part of a continuous and non-invasive blood pressure measurement device. Personal blood pressure measurement technology has remained relatively stagnant for decades, restricting those who take their blood pressure at home to using devices that operate with an inflatable pressure cuff. These devices are prohibitive in terms of both wearability and the ability to make measurements continuously. A device based on the methods explored in this thesis would be beneficial to anyone who requires at-home or 24-hour blood pressure monitoring without hindrance to daily activities, or blood pressure monitoring during exercise. In this thesis, a combination of ultrasound imaging and photoplethysmography are used to measure the diameter and the speed of a blood pulse traveling through the radial artery. Hemodynamic models suggest that these two metrics (arterial diameter and pulse wave velocity) are closely related to blood pressure and can be used to track changes in blood pressure at various points on the human body. To demonstrate proof of concept, two phases of a prototype device have been constructed. The first phase of the prototype makes use of an arterial phantom that simulates blood flow through an artificial artery immersed in a water bath. The purpose of the first prototype was to test the proposed method in a closed and controlled environment, using a non-destructive testing ultrasound probe for measuring the diameter of the phantom artery and pressure sensors for measuring the speed of a pressure pulse through the artery. The second phase of the prototype was built to perform measurements on human subjects. This stage used a medical ultrasound probe and photoplethysmography sensors to measure the diameter of the radial artery and local pulse wave velocity. Measurements with the phantom showed good correlation between the experimental method and absolute pressure measurement sensors. For human measurements, modelled blood pressure correlated well with values measured using a standard cuff-based blood pressure measurement device. Though the model showed good correlation with reference measurements, more work is needed on the prototype device before commercialization can be considered.},

The  research  carried  out  atthe  Center  for  Fast  Ultrasound  Imaging  has  demonstrated  thatsynthetic aperture focusing not only can be used in-vivo, but thatit  also  yields  superior  B-mode  and  blood  flow  images.In  the  last  years  synthetic  aperture  focusing  has  moved  fromthe  lab  to  commercial  products.

	abstract = {Digital ultrasound probes integrate the analog front end in the housing of the probe handle and provide a digital interface instead of requiring an expensive coaxial cable harness to connect. Current digital probes target the portable market and perform the bulk of the processing (beamforming) on the probe, which enables the probe to be connected to commodity devices, such as tablets or smartphones, running an ultrasound app to display the image and control the probe. Thermal constraints limit the number of front-end channels as well as the complexity of the processing. This prevents current digital probes to support advanced modalities, such as vector flow or elastography, requiring high-frame-rate imaging. In this paper, we present Light Probe, a digital ultrasound probe, which integrates a 64-channel 100- \${\textbackslash}textV\_{\textbackslash}text pp\$ TX/RX front end, including analog-to-digital conversion (up to 32.5 MS/s at 12 bit), and is equipped with an optical high-speed link (26.4 Gb/s) providing sustainable raw samples access to all the channels, which allows the processing to be performed on the connected device without thermal power constraints. By connecting the probe to a graphics processing unit-equipped PC, we demonstrate the flexibility of software-defined B-mode imaging using conventional and ultrafast methods. We achieve plane-wave and synthetic aperture imaging with frame rates from 30 up to 500 Hz consuming between 5.6 and 10.7 W. By using a combination of power and thermal management techniques, we demonstrate that the probe can remain within operating temperature limits even without active cooling, while never having to turn the probe off for cooling, hence providing a consistent quality of service for the operator.},

Conventional ultrasound machines usually require the use of expensive probes and bulky electronics because of the need to acquire and process hundreds of channel data simultaneously. In contrast, a single-element ultrasound system creates a virtual array by scanning an ultrasound element with robotic actuation and tracking instead of using a physical array of ultrasound elements as in conventional ultrasound machine. It not only enables visualization of procedures that otherwise require a custom probe but also dramatically reduces cost and improves the accessibility of image-guided intervention in point-of-care applications. In this work, we present a single-element ultrasound imaging system with a delta configuration actuator modified from a low-cost commercial off-the-shelf 3-D printer, which can serve as both a prototype for clinical application and a research platform. We demonstrated the capability of the system with experiments of spine visualization. We scanned a spine phantom with a needle-based ultrasound. The results indicate the feasibility of compact and economically friendly single-element ultrasound imaging solution for spinal intervention applicable to guiding lumbar puncture and epidural needle insertion.},

	abstract = {Clinicians generally agree that the most effective way to treat a malignant tumor within body organs is to detect it early. Currently, detection is mostly based on clinical diagnostics triggered by specific symptoms, which is often too late allowing the malignancy to reach an advanced stage. Automated high-resolution monitoring of body parts at regular intervals can be highly effective for detection of an anomalous growth - either primary or recurrence - at an early stage. In this paper, we propose a wearable, point-of-care (POC) ultrasonic imaging assembly to perform unsupervised, periodic monitoring of body parts for early detection of cancerous growths. We use ultrasound technology, which is safe, low-cost, can be easily miniaturized, and amenable for long-term, convenient, online monitoring. The proposed system is capable of providing automated high-resolution images of susceptible volumes of interest in superficial cancer-prone organs (e.g. prostate, uterus, kidney, ovary and bladder) at periodic intervals. We explore the design space for such a system encompassing transducer design parameters, power and memory requirements. Next, we study the effectiveness of such a system using both ultrasonic software simulation (with Field II) as well as experimental evaluation (with medical ultrasound transducers and phantoms). We show that the proposed POC diagnostic system can reliably detect an anomaly at a much smaller size (mostly stage 1) than typically achieved through conventional symptomatic detection.},

We present an open-source, vendor-independent, drag-and-drop software capable of automating the measurement process. A database of {\textasciitilde}8000 tissue Doppler beats (48 patients) from the septal and lateral annuli were analyzed by three expert echocardiographers. We developed an intensity- and gradient-based automated algorithm to measure tissue Doppler velocities. We tested its performance against manual measurements from the expert human operators. Our algorithm showed strong agreement with expert human operators. Performance was indistinguishable from a human operator: for algorithm, mean difference and SDD from the mean of human operators’ estimates 0.48 ± 1.12 cm/s (R2 = 0.82); for the humans individually this was 0.43 ± 1.11 cm/s (R2 = 0.84), −0.88 ± 1.12 cm/s (R2 = 0.84) and 0.41 ± 1.30 cm/s (R2 = 0.78). Agreement between operators and the automated algorithm was preserved when measuring at either the edge or middle of the trace. The algorithm was 10-fold quicker than manual measurements (p {\textless} 0.001). This open-source, vendor-independent, drag-and-drop software can make peak velocity measurements from pulsed wave tissue Doppler traces as accurately as human experts. This automation permits rapid, bias-resistant multi-beat analysis from spectral tissue Doppler images.},

We assess the utility and accuracy of this method in evaluating the function of the diaphragm and its contribution to respiratory workload. The developed system is able to monitor the diaphragm wall activity when the sensor is placed in the zone of apposition (ZOA). This system allows for direct measurements with only one ultrasound PZT5 piezo transducer. The system generates pulsed ultrasound waves at 2.2 MHz and amplifies reflected echoes. An added benefit of this system is that due to its design, the respiratory signal is less subject to motion artefacts. Promising results were obtained from six subjects performing six tests per subject with an average respiration detection sensitivity and specificity of 84\% and 93\%, respectively. Measurements were compared to a gold standard commercial spirometer. In this study, we also compared our measurements to other conventional methods such as inertial and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors.},

	abstract = {Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) systems improve the results and the standardization of surgical interventions. Anatomical landmarks and bone surface detection is straightforward to either register the surgical space with the pre-operative imaging space and to compute biomechanical parameters for prosthesis alignment. Surface points acquisition increases the intervention invasiveness and can be influenced by the soft tissue layer interposition (7-15mm localization errors). This study is aimed at evaluating the accuracy of a custom-made A-mode ultrasound (US) system for non invasive detection of anatomical landmarks and surfaces. A-mode solutions eliminate the necessity of US images segmentation, offers real-time signal processing and requires less invasive equipment. The system consists in a single transducer US probe optically tracked, a pulser/receiver and an FPGA-based board, which is responsible for logic control command generation and for real-time signal processing and three custom-made board (signal acquisition, blanking and synchronization). We propose a new calibration method of the US system. The experimental validation was then performed measuring the length of known-shape polymethylmethacrylate boxes filled with pure water and acquiring bone surface points on a bovine bone phantom covered with soft-tissue mimicking materials. Measurement errors were computed through MR and CT images acquisitions of the phantom. Points acquisition on bone surface with the US system demonstrated lower errors (1.2mm) than standard pointer acquisition (4.2mm).},

One significant advancement is the development of Wireless Medical Telemetry systems for Maternal-Fetal Monitoring. With wireless systems, patients can move freely around the hospital while their physiological parameters like Uterine and Fetal activity, Fetal Heart Rate and FECG/MECG are measured. This new model of patient care is a revolutionary advancement in modern healthcare. The Telemetry system consists of a Transmitter and a Receiver unit. The transmitter can capture Uterine Activity (UA) using TOCO transducer or Intrauterine Pressure Catheter (IUPC). Fetal Heart Rate by means of Ultrasound transducers and FECG/MECG parameters are measured by the 3-lead electrode system. The captured data is then transmitted wirelessly to a receiver unit using frequency ranges within WMTS band. The key component of the receiver is CPLD which is from Altera’s MAX II family. QuartusII programming tool is used to program the CPLD. The RTL schematic for enable signals for all the parameters is simulated using ModelSim. After the implementation of CPLD in the receiver main board, results are checked by measuring the values in the Fetal monitor which displays the maternal/fetal parameters.},

	abstract = {Acoustic performance in ultrasonic transmitters can be improved by means of a suitable electrical driving response and matching/tuning networks. It is important to predict this electrical response, but doing so is not easy because it departs notably from the nominal pattern with the loading probes. In practice, the analysis of HV pulser spikes in NDE applications requires fairly complex models in the transient regime and, in addition, non-linear problems could arise, especially in the case of tuned transmitters. In this paper, the most relevant influences of loading characteristics of NDT ultrasonic probes on the pulser electrical driving responses are evaluated in time and frequency domains. Conventional pulse generators and typical NDE pulsers are considered. Driving responses are analysed across commercial ultrasonic probes and, alternatively, across similar purely electrical loads. Distinct influences on pulser responses from electrical and motional sections of the probes are identified. All these aspects are studied on the basis of experimental and computer results.},

The approach is based on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) system intended mainly for steel thickness measurements. Ultrasound data reduction is desirable when: (1) direct measurements performed by an operator are not accessible; (2) it is required to store a considerable amount of data; (3) the application requires measuring at very high speeds; and (4) the physical space for the embedded hardware is limited. All the aforementioned scenarios can be present in applications such as pipeline inspection where data reduction is traditionally performed on-line using pipeline inspection gauges (PIG). The method proposed in this work consists of identifying and storing in real-time only the time of occurrence (TOO) and the maximum amplitude of each echo present in a given RF ultrasound signal. The method is tested with a dedicated immersion system where a significant data reduction with an average of 96.5\% is achieved.},

	abstract = {We present an ultrasonic transit-time gas flow meter (UFM) that features a 40-kHz 8×8 2D-phased array for transmitting ultrasonic sound waves up- and downstream to two single element receivers. This allows us to electronically compensate for the well-known parasitic sound drift effect, resulting in larger measurement range and better signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The UFM fabricated consists of a pipe with an inner diameter of 146mm with a flush-mounted 2D-phased array, embedded in a 3D-printed waveguide structure. The configuration was tested in a calibrated flow rig at various gas flow velocities. The received amplitudes without sound drift compensation, i.e. the transmitted waves emitted at beam steering angles of 30° and -30° reduce by 39\% and 26\%, respectively, when the flow velocity was ramped up to a maximum of 41 m/s. The amplitudes only dropped by 13\% in both cases at the maximum flow velocity of 41 m/s when the sound drift compensation was turned on.

	abstract = {Holographic techniques are fundamental to applications such as volumetric displays, high-density data storage and optical tweezers that require spatial control of intricate optical or acoustic fields within a three-dimensional volume. The basis of holography is spatial storage of the phase and/or amplitude profile of the desired wavefront in a manner that allows that wavefront to be reconstructed by interference when the hologram is illuminated with a suitable coherent source. Modern computer-generated holography skips the process of recording a hologram from a physical scene, and instead calculates the required phase profile before rendering it for reconstruction. In ultrasound applications, the phase profile is typically generated by discrete and independently driven ultrasound sources; however, these can only be used in small numbers, which limits the complexity or degrees of freedom that can be attained in the wavefront. Here we introduce monolithic acoustic holograms, which can reconstruct diffraction-limited acoustic pressure fields and thus arbitrary ultrasound beams. We use rapid fabrication to craft the holograms and achieve reconstruction degrees of freedom two orders of magnitude higher than commercial phased array sources. The technique is inexpensive, appropriate for both transmission and reflection elements, and scales well to higher information content, larger aperture size and higher power. The complex three-dimensional pressure and phase distributions produced by these acoustic holograms allow us to demonstrate new approaches to controlled ultrasonic manipulation of solids in water, and of liquids and solids in air. We expect that acoustic holograms will enable new capabilities in beam-steering and the contactless transfer of power, improve medical imaging, and drive new applications of ultrasound.},

In the experiments a 128-element linear transducer array with 0.3 mm pitch excited by a burst pulse of 125 ns duration were used. The comparison of 2D ultrasound images of tissue mimicking phantom obtained using the STA and the MSTA methods is presented to demonstrate the benefits of the second approach. The results were obtained using SA algorithm with transmit and receive signals correction based on a single element directivity function.},

	abstract = {3D ultrasound is becoming common for noninvasive medical imaging because of its high accuracy, safety, and ease of use. Unlike other modalities, ultrasound transducers require little power, which makes handheld imaging platforms possible, and several low-resolution 2D devices are commercially available today. However, the extreme computational requirements (and associated power requirements) of 3D ultrasound image formation have, to date, precluded handheld 3D-capable devices. The authors describe the Sonic Millip3De, a new system architecture and accelerator for 3D ultrasound beamforming--the most computationally intensive aspect of image formation. Their three-layer die-stacked design combines a new approach to the ultrasound imaging algorithm better suited to hardware with a custom beamforming accelerator that employs massive data parallelism and a streaming pipeline architecture to achieve high-quality 3D ultrasound imaging within a full-system power of 15 W in 45-nm semiconductor technology (400\&\#x00D7; less than a conventional DSP solution). Under anticipated scaling trends, the authors project that Sonic Millip3De will achieve the target 5-W power budget by the 16-nm technology node.},

To obtain high-quality images, we suggest a simple new approach to resolve the angular ambiguity inherent to ultrasound measurements based on circular wave-fronts. The analysis incorporates observations obtained at several adjacent positions of a sensing elements. The method is validated using simulated and real data of a human limb. The validation shows improvement of the image quality compared to the classical image reconstruction algorithm for such setups.},

The aim of this paper is then oriented to provide such CoK for canisters by an identification and authentication based on ultrasound. This paper describes an authentication method oriented to prevent falsification of copper canisters. According to the ultrasonic investigation of the friction stir welding process of the copper lid onto the cylindrical tube, the ultrasonic response of the remaining gap partially filled during the welding is used as a unique pattern for authentication. The analysis of various measurements made on angular sections of copper lids friction stir welded onto the tube revealed the feasibility of acquisition of a valuable signal from the reflection of the internal gap. Following the observations on this data set, a possible technical design is detailed, where the identification and authentication methods can be combined with immersion probes.},

Forty-five (22 males, 23 females) National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division-I athletes volunteered for this study. Subjects were measured once in the BOD POD then twice by two technicians for skinfolds and ultrasound. A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant differences between body composition methods (F = 13.24, p {\textless} 0.01, η² = 0.24). This difference was further explained by a sex-specific effect such that the mean difference between ultrasound and BOD POD was large for females ({\textasciitilde} 5\% BF) but small for males ({\textasciitilde} 1.5\% BF). Linear regression using the \%BF estimate from ultrasound to predict \%BF from BOD POD resulted in an R2 = 0.849, SEE = 2.6\% BF and a TE = 4.4\% BF. The inter-rater intraclass correlation (ICC) for skinfold was 0.966 with a large 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.328 to 0.991. The inter-rater ICC for ultrasound was 0.987 with a much smaller 95\% CI of 0.976 to 0.993. Both skinfolds and ultrasound had test-retest ICCs ≥ 0.996. The BX2000 ultrasound device had excellent test-retest reliability, and its inter-rater reliability was superior to the skinfold method. The validity of this method is questionable, particularly for female athletes. However, due to its excellent reliability, coaches and trainers should consider this portable and easy to use A-mode ultrasound to assess body composition changes in athletes.},

	abstract = {People in developing countries have limited access to lifesaving diagnostic equipment. Because medical imaging devices are stationary and costly, there exists a need for imaging technology that is not only accurate and portable, but also inexpensive. To address this issue, we developed and tested an inexpensive portable ultrasound device. Three microprocessing boards compose the device: a SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green, an Arduino Uno, and a Murgen board. The BeagleBone powers and controls the Murgen board. The Murgen board pulses a 5MHz singleelement transducer, rotated by the Arduino, and receives the echoes. We programmed acquisition and image reconstruction procedures for the device and assessed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in images of high-contrast graphite laboratory phantoms as well as standard clinical phantoms manufactured by Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc. (CIRS). Reconstructed images of laboratory phantoms yielded an SNR of 9.3 dB, which was acceptable for imaging high-contrast targets. Some targets in the CIRS phantom were visible, but the SNR remained below an acceptable threshold, revealing the need for additional signal processing and noise reduction. All in all, we have demonstrated the feasibility of, identified further improvement for, and laid the foundation for an inexpensive portable ultra-sound device.},

	url = {http://bdm.unb.br/handle/10483/20117},
	abstract = {A obesidade vem se tornando um problema cada vez mais sério devido ao fato de ser a precursora de diversos outros problemas de saúde. Além disso, vale destacar a estigmatização social causada aos indivíduos que sofrem com tal doença, uma vez que são frequentemente discriminados devido à aparência física. Apesar de a obesidade ser uma doença séria, deve-se notar que é um problema evitável, quando tomadas as devidas ações. Dessa maneira, um dispositivo que seja capaz de medir a espessura da camada adiposa em determinados pontos do corpo se mostra útil. O monitoramento contínuo da composição do corpo pode auxiliar na prescrição de dietas personalizadas e na determinação da eficiência de certos exercícios físicos para o paciente. Dessa forma, este trabalho aborda a pesquisa de referencial teórico, que permite a identificação dos parâmetros e variáveis relacionados à implementação do protótipo de uma solução portátil capaz de determinar, via ultrassom em Modo A (Amplitude), a espessura da camada adiposa. Além disso, são descritas as etapas percorridas durante o desenvolvimento do protótipo de bancada utilizado para validação. Os ensaios iniciais realizados em um bloco de teste concebido em acrílico mostraram a reprodutibilidade e relativa precisão da técnica, uma vez que obtiveram-se desvio padrão (𝜎) 0,04 {\textless} 𝜎 (mm) {\textless} 0,13 e Erro Quadrático Médio (EQM) 0,08 {\textless} EQM (mm) {\textless} 1,43. Com respeito aos testes executados em voluntários, observou-se uma forte concordância (utilizando a análise do gráfico de Bland-Altman) entre as medidas realizadas utilizando aparelhos convencionais (GE Logiq 100 Pro e adipômetro) e as medidas realizadas utilizando o protótipo desenvolvido. Dessa maneira, tendo em vista os resultados obtidos, a relevância e o potencial comercial do projeto, justifica-se a execução do mesmo. Além disso, este trabalho aborda conceitos e técnicas que podem servir como ponto de partida para futuros trabalhos envolvendo outras aplicações do ultrassom como controle de qualidade de alimentos e seleção de suínos reprodutores em granjas comerciais a partir da identificação da espessura do toucinho.},

Routine cardiac check-ups are therefore suggested by clinicians to detect CVD at an early stage. Unfortunately, existing methods for cardiac diagnosis are costly and time-consuming as in most of the cases, these facilities are available only in hospitals or clinics. In this article, a novel wearable ultrasonic imaging assembly is proposed for routine monitoring of the carotid arteries in an easy-to-use and economical way. Using standard B-mode ultrasound, which is suitable for wearable form factors, the device monitors intima–media thickness (IMT), which is a proven indicator of cardiovascular disease. The design parameters for all the essential hardware components of the proposed wearable imaging system along with an efficient algorithm for predicting IMT anomalies from ultrasound images are proposed. Finally, we describe a custom-designed prototype of the proposed system and demonstrate its capability in acquiring ultrasound images.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound is one of the leading medical imaging modalities because it is safe, noninvasive, portable, easy to use, relatively inexpensive and displays images in real-time. Due to its real-time nature, an ultrasound machine must be able to process its incoming data quickly. High computational and throughput requirements in modern ultrasound machines have restricted their internal design to algorithm-specific hardware with limited programmability. Adding new ultrasound imaging applications or improving a machine's internal algorithms can require costly hardware redesigns and replacements of boards or of the entire machine. In an effort to address these problems, we have reviewed each of the essential functions in modern ultrasound machines and analyzed their computational requirements in programmable systems. These functions include dynamic downconversion, tissue signal processing, color flow processing, scan conversion, and tissue/flow decision. Our estimate of the total computing requirement to current ultrasound machines is 54.71 billion operations per second (BOPS) when transcendental functions are implemented in software and 31.26 BOPS when transcendental functions are implemented in lookup tables taking 160.26 Mbytes of memory. To investigate the feasibility of programmable generalized ultrasound systems, we have designed a flexible and parallel programmable ultrasound processing subsystem, called the Programmable Ultrasound Image Processor (PUIP). As the need for programmable ultrasound machines increases in the future due to various advantages (e.g., lower system cost, faster clinical use and lower research/development expenses), it will be crucial to develop not only a high-performance, scalable, reconfigurable parallel computer architecture meeting the computing requirement, but also efficient ultrasound algorithms that can be optimally mapped into the parallel architecture.},

We start with a high level system overview, followed by a more detailed description of how ultrasound systems work. System Introduction Medical ultrasound machines are among the most sophisticated signal processing machines in widespread use today. As in any complex machine, there are many trade-offs in implementation due to performance requirements, physics, and cost. Some system-level understanding is necessary to fully appreciate the desired front-end IC functions and performance levels, especially for: the low-noise amplifier (LNA); time gain compensation amplifier (TGC); and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Ultrasound scanning has been widely used for preliminary diagnosis as it is non-invasive and has good scope for the doctors to analyze many diseases. Due to lack of trained radiologists in remote areas, tele-radiology is used to diagnose the scanned ultrasound data. Availability of online radiographers and having communication facility for the portable ultrasound are issues in tele-radiology for using ultrasound scanning in remote health-care. In these situations, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) will be beneficial in diagnosing the patients with minimal manual intervention. Methods: We proposed FPGA based CAD algorithm for abnormality detection of kidney in ultrasound images. The proposed algorithm works in the following way: as a pre-processing, an ultrasound image is denoised and region of interest of kidney in ultrasound image is segmented. Intensity histogram features and Haralick features are extracted from the segmented kidney region. Based on extracted features, the classification algorithm is implemented in two stages. In first stage, a Look Up Table (LUT) based approach is used to differentiate between normal and abnormal kidney images. In second stage, after confirming the abnormality, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with extracted features is used to further classify the presence of stone or cyst in kidney. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a FPGA based Xilinx Kintex-7 board. Results: The proposed algorithm gave an accuracy of 98.14\%, sensitivity of 100\% and specificity of 96.82\% in detecting the exact abnormality present in kidney ultrasound images. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and its hardware implementation will be beneficial for diagnosing the kidney in absence of radiologists and internet connectivity.},

The deconvolution concept from linear system theory (LST) is linked to the wave equation formulation of the imaging process, and an analytic formula for the PSF of planar transducers is derived. For this analytic expression, different numerical and analytic approximation schemes for evaluating the PSF are presented. By comparing simulated images with measured C-scan images, we demonstrate that the assumptions of LST in combination with our formula for the PSF are a good model for the pulse-echo imaging process. To reconstruct the object from a C-scan image, we compare different deconvolution schemes: the Wiener filter, the ForWaRD algorithm, and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. The best results are obtained with the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with total variation regularization. For distances greater or equal twice the near field distance, our experiments show that the numerically computed PSF can be replaced with a simple closed analytic term based on a far field approximation.},

METHODS: Controlled trials identified through systematic literature reviews were included. Design of splints and exercise programs were evaluated according to existing recommendations and classification systems. The risk of bias was assessed by 2 independent reviewers and effects were summarized descriptively or by meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Twelve trials were included in the review: 7 assessed the effect of splints, 3 the effect of exercises, and 2 a combination of splints and exercises. The results revealed a great variety in the design of splint and exercise programs. A meta-analysis of the 2 randomized trials with low risk of bias demonstrated that splints significantly reduced hand pain at short-term ({\textless}3 months) and long-term (≥3 months) followup, with a standardized mean difference of 0.37 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.03, 0.71) and 0.80 (95\% CI 0.45, 1.15), respectively. Further, results from single trials indicated that hand exercises may reduce pain and increase range of motion and strength, while a combination of splints and daily exercises may reduce pain and stiffness and improve function.
CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence that splints reduce hand pain, but limited evidence for the effects of hand exercises and a combination of hand exercises and splints in hand osteoarthritis.},

In response to this imaging performance gap we have been developing a clinical breast imaging methodology based on the principles of ultrasound tomography. The Computed Ultrasound Risk Evaluation (CURE) system has been designed with the clinical goals of whole breast, operator-independent imaging, and differentiation of breast masses. This paper describes the first clinical prototype, summarizes our initial image reconstruction techniques, and presents phantom and preliminary in vivo results. In an initial assessment of its in vivo performance, we have examined 50 women with the CURE prototype and obtained the following results. (1) Tomographic imaging of breast architecture is demonstrated in both CURE modes of reflection and transmission imaging. (2) In-plane spatial resolution of 0.5 mm in reflection and 4 mm in transmission is achieved. (3) Masses {\textgreater} 15 mm in size are routinely detected. (4) Reflection, sound speed, and attenuation imaging of breast masses are demonstrated. These initial results indicate that operator-independent, whole-breast imaging and the detection of breast masses are feasible. Future studies will focus on improved detection and differentiation of masses in support of our long-term goal of increasing the specificity of breast exams, thereby reducing the number of biopsies of benign masses.},

	abstract = {An ultrasonic ring transducer system has been developed for experimental studies of scattering and imaging. The transducer consists of 2048 rectangular elements with a 2.5-MHz center frequency, a 67\% -6 dB bandwidth, and a 0.23-mm pitch arranged in a 150-mm-diameter ring with a 25-mm elevation. At the center frequency, the element size is 0.30lambda x 42lambda and the pitch is 0.38lambda. The system has 128 parallel transmit channels, 16 parallel receive channels, a 2048:128 transmit multiplexer, a 2048:16 receive multiplexer, independently programmable transmit waveforms with 8-bit resolution, and receive amplifiers with time variable gain independently programmable over a 40-dB range. Receive signals are sampled at 20 MHz with 12-bit resolution. Arbitrary transmit and receive apertures can be synthesized. Calibration software minimizes system nonidealities caused by noncircularity of the ring and element-to-element response differences. Application software enables the system to be used by specification of high-level parameters in control files from which low-level hardware-dependent parameters are derived by specialized code. Use of the system is illustrated by producing focused and steered beams, synthesizing a spatially limited plane wave, measuring angular scattering, and forming b-scan images.},

However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities. This study paves the way to deeper and extensive studies on how to support communities engaged in open source design of hardware products.},

	abstract = {This is the raw data set on which the article "What is the source of open source hardware?" to be published in the Journal of Open Hardware under an open access license is based. The abstract of the article is as follows: "What “open source” means once applied to tangible products has been so far exclusively addressed through the light of licensing. While this approach is adapted for software, it appears to be over-simplistic for complex hardware products. Whether such a product can be labelled as open source is not only a question of license but also a question of documentation, i.e. what is the information that sufficiently describes it? In other words, what is the “source” of open source hardware? To date there is no trivial answer to this question, leaving large room for interpretation in the usage of the term. Based on analysis of public documentation of 132 products, this paper provides an overview of how practitioners tend to interpret the concept of open source hardware. Results empirically confirm the existence of two main usages of the open source principles in the context of tangible products: publication of product-related documentation as a means to support community-based product development and to disseminate privately developed innovations. It also underlines the high variety of interpretations and even misuses of the concept of open source hardware. This reveals in turn that this concept may not even be clear to practitioners and calls for more narrowed down definitions of what has to be shared for a product to be called open source. Results gained by the analysis of current publication practice are summarized in the definition of an open source hardware lifecycle to contribute towards this effort."},

In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field.},

There are ways to improve equality and efficiency and decrease costs in this area without fundamentally changing current health systems and business models. Many services and products are experiencing a paradigm shift toward an open source economic model that can be extended to medical technologies in a way that will intrinsically promote sustainable growth and innovations while improving education and global health. This new way of thinking offers an infrastructure by which some sectors of global health can be democratized. Here we present an in-depth discussion of the advantages of open source medical technology for the public and private sectors, then provide a concrete example of the progress of our efforts to develop an open source magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Based on our calculations such an instrument could potentially result in cost savings of up to \$3.3 billion within about 20 years for the German healthcare system alone. On a global scale the implications of an affordable open source MRI would be even more striking. We suggest a series of milestones to be met to a widespread development of open source medical technology with the aim of improving global health in a way that is less restricted by current political and economic borders.},

Current methods of carotid artery compliance evaluation include B-mode scanners or single channel A-mode scanner. The B-mode scanner method needs extensive image processing algorithms and the cost is expensive, while the single channel A-mode scanner method easily results in huge measurement errors. To solve these problems, an eight-channel A-mode ultrasound system for carotid artery compliance measuring was invented. The system was tested by the carotid phantom models and its accuracy was compared with the single channel A-mode and B-mode scanner. Our Result shows that this eight channel A-mode system could measure the carotid compliance accurately and could be an alternative for the B-mode scanner.},

	abstract = {Current clinical standards for endoscopy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract combine high definition optics and ultrasound imaging to view the lumen superficially and through its thickness. However, these instruments are limited to the length of an endoscope and the only clinically available, autonomous devices able to travel the full length of the GI tract easily offer only video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Our work seeks to overcome this limitation with a device (“Sonopill”) for multimodal capsule endoscopy, providing optical and microultrasound (μUS) imaging and supporting sensors1.μUS transducers have been developed with multiple piezoelectric materials operating across a range of centre frequencies to study viability in the GI tract. Because of the combined constraints of μUS imaging and the low power / heat tolerance of autonomous devices, a hybrid approach has been taken to the transducer design, with separate transmit and receive arrays allowing multiple manufacturing approaches to maximise system efficiency. To explore these approaches fully, prototype devices have been developed with PVDF, high-frequency PZT and PMN-PT composites, and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer arrays. Test capsules have been developed using 3D printing to investigate issues including power consumption, heat generation / dissipation, acoustic coupling, signal strength and capsule integrity. Because of the high functional density of the electronics in our proposed system, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have been developed to realise the ultrasound transmit and receive circuitry along with white-light and autofluorescence imaging with singlephoton avalanche detectors (SPADs). The ultrasound ASIC has been developed and the SPAD electronics and optical subsystem have been validated experimentally. The functionality of various transducer materials.},

	abstract = {The presented work demonstrates the most suitable architecture for the FPGA-based signal processing which makes available various real-time filtering algorithms, such as band pass, high pass, low pass, and band-reject for FIR filters. The processor was implemented with the fixed-point arithmetic using VHDL, which can be downloadable on FPGA device. The FPGA device can be interfaced with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and a personal computer with MATLAB for the user interface and feeding coefficients and order of the filter. The core part of this paper was to find the reconfigurable and efficient architecture of the processor with only one multiplier which can work for Finite Impulse response (FIR) filter with the best- suited structure. The system will be used for automatic generation of fixed-point FIR filters. The model was also implemented in MATLAB script and the verification of results in the case of low-pass filtering confirmed that both models in MATLAB and VHDL matched to each other. All components of architecture in VHDL were designed using generics which allow changing its structure and behavior by generic values. Therefore, it is a universal filter platform where user can process the data while changing the filter parameters as per the requirement of applications. The complete design was verified by taking the example of audio signal frequency, but parameterized components of system architecture can also facilitate its applicability at ultrasonic frequencies by changing the algorithm. The significance and applicability of FPGAs in ultrasonic signal processing were also studied and reviewed.},

In this work a mobile ultrasound system for the purpose of fast and reliable majority determination is developed and clinically evaluated using machine learning for classification without the need of a physician trained for age determination. In women, the complete fusion of the distal growth plate in ulna and radius bones correlates with reaching the age of 18. The existence of this growth plate is measured using the developed mobile multichannel ultrasound system. Its main parts are a low cost and low power FPGA, a fully integrated 8 channel transceiver and a WIFI module for data transfer to a mobile device. A pair of ultrasound array transducers (4 elements with 11x11 mm aperture each, 1 MHz center frequency) is positioned and moved up to 15 mm for reflection and transmission measurements through the forearm resulting in measurements of multiple paths through an existing growth plate leading to more robust results. The detection of growth plate existence was done using machine learning approaches. Different types of artificial neural nets were used. The system has been evaluated successfully in a clinical study with 149 women at Saarland University Medical Center. Classical signal processing analyzing the change of ultrasound signals during transducer movement over the growth plate showed that a difference between underage and legal age women is contained in the data, but classification had to be done using machine learning methods. The best performance for binary majority classification was achieved using a ResNet with an F1 score of approximately 84 \% showing the capabilities of the setup. Currently, a multi-center study started to increase the number of data used for training the artificial neural nets, improving these results further while adapting the technology even to male subject groups.},

	abstract = {Real-time imaging, using ultrasound techniques, is a complex task in non-destructive evaluation. In this context, fast and precise control systems require design of specialized parallel architectures. Total focusing method (TFM) for ultrasound imaging has many advantages in terms of flexibility and accuracy in comparison to traditional imaging techniques. However, one major drawback is the high number of data acquisitions and computing requirements for this imaging technique. Due to those constraints, the TFM algorithm was earlier classified in the field of post-processing tasks. This paper describes a multi-FPGA architecture for real-time TFM imaging using the full matrix capture (FMC). In the acquisition process, data are acquired using a phased array and processed with synthetic focusing techniques such as the TFM algorithm. The FMC-TFM architecture consists of a set of interconnected FPGAs integrated on an embedded system. Initially, this imaging system was dedicated to data acquisition using a phased array. The algorithm was reviewed and partitioned to parallelize processing tasks on FPGAs. The architecture was entirely described using VHDL language, synthesized and implemented on a V5FX70T Xilinx FPGA for the control and high-level processing tasks and four V5SX95T Xilinx FPGAs for the acquisition and low-level processing tasks. The designed architecture performs real-time FMC-TFM imaging with a good characterization of defects.},

The proposed architecture exploits the negative odd-symmetry and interleaved zero-valued coefficients of a Hilbert Transform-based FIR filter to reduce hardware resource requirements and complexity. The hardware design is modeled using the DSP Builder development tool allowing the automatic generation of HDL algorithms directly from the Matlab/Simulink environment. The generated VHDL code was synthesized for an Intel Stratix IV FPGA and validated on a Terasic DE4-230 board. The accuracy and performance of the envelope detector are analyzed with real ultrasound phantom data for different filter orders, coefficient length and two filter design methods: Equiripple and Least-Squares. The normalized residual sum of squares (NRSS) and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) cost functions are used for comparison with the reference absolute value of the Matlab Hilbert function. The results demonstrate that the proposed method yields similar results to conventional envelope detection methods, while being simpler to implement and requiring lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {Pursuing better imaging quality and miniaturizing imaging devices are two trends in the current development of ultrasound imaging. While the first one leads to more complex and expensive imaging equipment, poor image quality is a common problem of portable ultrasound imaging systems. In this paper, an image reconstruction method was proposed to break through the imaging quality limitation of portable devices by introducing generative adversarial network (GAN) model into the field of ultrasound image reconstruction. We combined two GAN generator models, the encoder-decoder model and the U-Net model to build a sparse skip connection U-Net (SSC U-Net) to tackle this problem. To produce more realistic output, stabilize the training procedure, and improve spatial resolution in the reconstructed ultrasound images, a new loss function which combines adversarial loss, L1 loss, and differential loss was proposed. Three datasets including 50 pairs of simulation, 40 pairs of phantom, and 72 pairs of in vivo images were used to evaluate the reconstruction performance. Experimental results show that our SSC U-Net is able to reconstruct ultrasound images with improved quality. Compared with U-Net, our SSC U-Net is able to preserve more details in the reconstructed images and improve full width at half maximum (FWHM) of point targets by 3.23\%.},

In order to solve this problem, an automatic frequency tracking system based on FPGA is developed. The system makes use of fast Fourier transform (FFT) combined with fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm. Then, a frequency-tracking strategy is proposed to catch the optimal working frequency. The upper computer software is used to control and monitor the whole system, which is more convenient for various application scenarios. It is proven that the tracking of resonant frequency of the ultrasonic transducer can be achieved quickly and accurately. Furthermore, the main advantage of the design system is miniature, versatility and high stability. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed system is validated by an experimental example.},

	abstract = {Increasing maturation and dissemination of easy-to-use and affordable means of digital production (e.g. 3D printing), access to these in makerspaces and FabLabs as well as powerful tools and online platforms for virtual and collaborative product design enabled the highly efficient and innovative mode of open source to spill over from software to hardware. Open source technology has enormous potential to spur innovation and enhance technological literacy and thus contribute to socioeconomic and ecological sustainability. Like in software, open source hardware (OSH) projects and online communities have evolved in a broad range of technologies and applications. In these communities, people from all over the world with diverse backgrounds (students, researchers, consumers, users etc.) gather online to jointly develop, revise, improve and freely share hardware designs and documentation. Additionally, people may build, adapt, use and sell physical artefacts based on these designs in accordance with the notion of open source. The (potential) economic impact and value of open source hardware is hard to quantify as contributors usually do not get paid and users do not necessarily buy products from vendors. Nonetheless, value is created as in the case of Linux or Wikipedia. We applied established valuation methods for open source hardware to quantify cost savings and as a result the value of an open source magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) currently under development by the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI2). Depending on the scenario and the valuation method, we found that savings for healthcare systems from US\$1.8 million up to US\$222 million per year are possible in the near future making the case for public funding and private investment in open source technology development.},

	abstract = {Sometimes, businesses restrict their hardware products with intellectual property legal instruments to maintain near-monopolies in market niches. This proprietary approach to technology risks creating anti-competitive rent-seeking behaviour and comes with its own set of economic and social costs. In The Hardware Hacker, Andrew ‘Bunnie’ Huang builds on his entrepreneurial experience in manufacturing hardware to provide a viable alternative. In addition to extensive tips on the practicalities of hardware mass production, Huang’s book documents the thriving technology counterculture in Shenzhen, China’s ‘Silicon Valley’. Called the ‘shanzhai’, these entrepreneurs ignore patent and copyright restrictions and openly copy features from other products to remix them into new ones. While some call them thieves, shanzhai innovations pre-empted now-common device categories such as the smartwatch, and may address market niches unreachable by intellectual property-encumbered business models. Huang personally experimented with this approach (while operating within existing intellectual property laws) through his open hardware business ventures – notably the Novena open laptop – and in this book discusses the lessons learned. They include reflections on access to hardware as a form of civic action, implications of advances in biotechnology, and an optimistic view on the growth of open hardware in light of the deceleration of Moore’s Law. Refreshingly accessible and entertaining, The Hardware Hacker shows us the importance of the right to tinker in an age where technology permeates all aspects of life.},

An external laptop with a custom graphical user interface synchronously acquired sensor data and 2D ultrasound images using a Siemens 9L4 probe (depth = 4 cm) and S2000 scanner with a video capture device. Sensor data was stabilized with a gradient descent orientation filter and used to reconstruct a 3D image volume from 500 2D frames, acquired over an irregular path in an abdominal phantom over 15 seconds. The 3D reconstruction time was 30 seconds, and the quality of the 3D image volume was comparable to that of the raw 2D images. These results demonstrate that freehand 3D ultrasound can be practically achieved using low-cost sensors.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new feature, average Higuchi dimension of RF time series (AHDRFT), for detection of prostate cancer using ultrasound data. The proposed feature is extracted from RF echo signals acquired from prostate tissue in an in vitro setting and is used in combination with texture features extracted from the corresponding B-scan images. In a novel approach towards RF data collection, we continuously recorded backscattered echoes from the prostate tissue to acquire time series of the RF signals. We also collected B-scan images and performed a detailed histopathologic analysis on the tissue. To compute AHDRFT, the Higuchi fractal dimensions of the RF time series were averaged over a region of interest. AHDRFT and texture features extracted from corresponding B-scan images were used to classify regions of interest, as small as 0.028 cm of the prostate tissue in cancerous and normal classes. We validated the results based on our histopathologic maps. A combination of image statistical moments and features extracted from co-occurrence matrices of the B-scan images resulted in classification accuracy of around 87\%. When AHDRFT was added to the feature vectors, the classification accuracy was consistently over 95\% with best results of over 99\% accuracy. Our results show that the RF time series backscattered from prostate tissues contain information that can be used for detection of prostate cancer},

	abstract = {The capability of ultrasound transmission tomography to reconstruct acoustic parameters of proven histological relevance like acoustic speed and attenuation has been established over the past few decades by several researchers. The approach taken so far was a fully custom designed transmission tomography system which is a considerably multifaceted venture. The outcome of the earlier research proved the feasibility of the concept but fell short of the clinical requirements due to its inadequate spatial resolution and reconstruction accuracy on one hand and its experimental nature on the other hand. The major consideration behind the novel approach presented here is to make use of a commercially available ultrasound system and to supplement it with an add-on module, the latter being designed to extend the function of the former to realize a transmission ultrasound mode. The ultrasound transmission data of an object, when acquired from multiple directions, allows spatially resolved tomographic reconstruction of parameters like acoustic speed and acoustic attenuation. The use of a standard ultrasound system makes the acquisition of transmission as well as echo data of the whole object possible; the latter allows a further processing for three dimensional rendering of the echosonographic image, compounding and tissue characterization based on multiple parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an ultrasound system to monitor cardiac motion using miniature transducers attached directly to the epicardial surface. Our aim was to develop both a research tool for detailed studies of cardiac mechanics and a continuous, real time system for peri-operative evaluation of heart function. The system was tested on a porcine model. Two 3 mm diameter, 10 MHz ultrasound transducers were sutured to the epicardial surface. As the epicardial surface was the reference for the velocity and strain estimations, this procedure compensated for the motion of the heart. The short distance allowed for the use of high frequencies and pulse repetition rates. The system was driven in pulse-echo mode, using electronics developed for the application, and radio frequency (RF) lines were recorded at a pulse repetition rate of 2500 s−1. The endocardial border was detected using an algorithm based on fuzzy logic with filtration to reduce noise and remove outliers, and the myocardium was divided into four layers. Inside the myocardium, radial tissue velocity as a function of depth was calculated from the recorded RF signals, and the velocity estimates were used to estimate radial strain rate and strain and to track the motion of the myocardial layers. The scope of this paper is technical, giving a detailed description of system design, hardware electronics and algorithms, with examples of processed velocity patterns and myocardial strain curves. The results from this study on a porcine model demonstrate the system's ability to estimate myocardial velocity and strain patterns and to track the motion of the myocardial layers, thereby obtaining detailed information of the regional function of the myocardium.},

The clinical application of ultra-high frequency ultrasound can reduce the number of invasive procedures, such as biopsies, and assist in surgical planning.

We present a new handheld high-resolution ultrasonic imager designed for dermatological use. The device operates at 50-100 MHz and provides B-scan images with up to 4 mm penetration depth and 40μm axial resolution. Adaptive signal processing algorithms allow highlighting anatomical and pathological features of the skin tissue. The primary skin layers, as well as the skin appendages, are clearly detectable on the obtained acoustical images. High-resolution characterization of skin morphology allows assessing the overall condition of the skin and can be used for diagnostic purposes. The new device will be useful for the number of dermatological applications: surgery planning and image-guided intervention, assessment of wound healing and skin grafts, vascular anomalies, inflammatory diseases, and numerous cosmetic complications.},

	abstract = {Wireless capsule endoscopy has been used for the clinical examination of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for two decades. However, most commercially available devices only utilise optical imaging to examine the GI wall surface. Using this sensing modality, pathology within the GI wall cannot be detected. Micro-ultrasound (μUS) using high-frequency ({\textgreater}20 MHz) ultrasound can provide a means of transmural or cross-sectional image of the GI tract. Depth of imaging is approximately 10 mm with a resolution of between 40–120 μm that is sufficient to differentiate between subsurface histologic layers of the various regions of the GI tract. Ultrasound capsule endoscopy (USCE) uses a capsule equipped with μUS transducers that are capable of imaging below the GI wall surface, offering thereby a complementary sensing technique to optical imaging capsule endoscopy. In this work, a USCE device integrated with a ∼30 MHz ultrasonic transducer was developed to capture a full 360° image of the lumen. The performance of the device was initially evaluated using a wire phantom, indicating an axial resolution of 69.0 μm and lateral resolution of 262.5 μm. Later, in vivo imaging performance was characterised in the oesophagus and small intestine of anaesthetized pigs. The reconstructed images demonstrate clear layer differentiation of the lumen wall. The tissue thicknesses measured from the B-scan images show good agreement with ex vivo images from the literature. The high-resolution ultrasound images in the in vivo porcine model achieved with this device is an encouraging preliminary step in the translation of these devices toward future clinical use.},

	abstract = {Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) usually uses ultrasound with center frequency of 20–60 MHz, which is noted down as high frequency ultrasound (Sun et al. in Ultrasound Med Biol 34(1):31–39, 2008; Silverman et al. in Ophthalmology 114(4):816–822, 2007), ultrasound biomicroscopy (Vogt and Ermert in IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control 54(8):1551–1559, 2007; Foster et al. in Ultrasound Med Biol 26(1):1–27, 2000) or micro-ultrasound (Stuart Foster et al. in Interface Focus 1:576–601, 2011; Foster et al. in Ultrasound Med Biol 35(10): 1700–1708, 2009) in ultrasound society. Since the center frequency of ultrasound is higher than traditional ultrasound (2–15 MHz) for high-resolution imaging, the system design is different from the traditional scheme. Separate commercial modules with high performance are usually chosen for research application (Sun et al. in IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 55(8):2039–2049, 2008) regardless of their high cost and large size. It would provide a platform for concept verification due to their fast implementations. But for industry, the system would usually consider the cost and integration. Therefore, the design of the electric system should be easy to manufacture and mass produce.},

In particular, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) is designed for ultrasonic flaw echo detection. The input to MLPNN is segments of backscattered signals, and regions within the Split Spectrum Processing (SSP) 2D distribution. The experimental results show that MLPNN can detect the flaw echo in the backscattered signal with very high precision.},

	abstract = {Array Signal Processor (ASP) is widely used in antenna-array beamforming applications, such as RADAR, SONAR, Medical Ultrasound, Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) etc. In this paper, architecture and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Prototype of a Cycle Steeling Direct Memory Access (DMA) Digital Beamformer (DBF) for Ultrasound Sector Imaging Systems is proposed. The architecture is based on delay and sum and it requires Fine Delay (FD) and Coarse Delay (CD) values to steer and dynamically focus the array, and apodization weights to improve the directivity. To improve the Fine delay accuracy Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) interpolation filter is proposed and implemented. To support wide Field of View (FOV) steering, immense delay values are required and real-time computations are hard for high sampling rate systems. Also, the precomputed delay values require huge memory, which causes a significant increase in the ASP area. To solve this problem, a cycle stealing DMA controller based on Quad Serial Peripheral (QSPI) interface to load delay values from external flash without disturbing ASP processing has been proposed and realized. Moreover, for debuggability,the architecture supports custom JTAG debug interface logic and lock-up latch based Design for Testability (DFT) Scan chain for multiple clock domains. The paper also presents the design and implementation of an Ultrasound Sector Imaging System Prototype setup to emulate the ASP. Most of the existing research work in this area supports ultrasound echo acquisition to PC and processing. However, the designed prototype helps researchers to validate computationally complex Ultrasound signal processing algorithms like ASP on FPGA and further processing on PC.},

A mechanically-flexible linear 64-element array of piezoelectric transducers with a resonance frequency of 5 MHz was designed for nerve localization. A second 8-element array using larger elements was integrated on the wearable probe for low intensity focused ultrasound neuromodulation at a resonance frequency of 1.3 MHz. Full-wave simulations were used to model the flexible arrays and estimate their generated pressure profiles. A focal depth of 10–20 mm was assumed for beamforming and focusing to support modulation of the vagus, tibial, and other nerves. A strain sensor integrated on the probe provides patient-specific feedback information on array curvature for real-time optimization of focusing and image processing. Each patch also includes high voltage (HV) multiplexers, transmit/receive switches, and pre-amplifiers that simplify connectivity and also improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received echo signals by \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 dB. Experimental results from a flexible prototype show a sensitivity of 80 kPa/V with \${\textbackslash}sim\$3 MHz bandwidth for the modulation and 20 kPa/V with \${\textbackslash}sim\$6 MHz bandwidth for the imaging array.

	abstract = {The market for process instruments generally requires low cost devices that are robust, small in size, portable, and usable in-plant. Ultrasonic torsional guided wave sensors have received much attention by researchers for measurement of viscosity and/or density of fluids in recent years. The supporting electronic systems for these sensors providing many different settings of sine-wave signals are bulky and expensive. In contrast, a system based on bursts of square waves instead of sine waves would have a considerable advantage in that respect and could be built using simple integrated circuits at a cost that is orders of magnitude lower than for a windowed sine wave device. This paper explores the possibility of using square wave bursts as the driving signal source for the ultrasonic torsional guided wave viscosity sensor. A simple design of a compact and fully automatic analogue square wave front-end for the sensor is also proposed. The successful operation of the system is demonstrated by using the sensor for measuring the viscosity in a representative fluid. This work provides the basis for design and manufacture of low cost compact standalone ultrasonic guided wave sensors and enlightens the possibility of using coded excitation techniques utilising square wave sequences in such applications.},

	abstract = {Respiratory behavior contains crucial parameters to feature lung functionality, including respiratory rate, profile, and volume. The current well-adopted method to characterize respiratory behavior is spirometry using a spirometer, which is bulky, heavy, expensive, requires a trained provider to operate, and is incapable of continuous monitoring of respiratory behavior, which is often critical to assess chronic respiratory diseases. This work presents a wireless wearable sensor on a paper substrate that is capable of continuous monitoring of respiratory behavior and delivering the clinically relevant respiratory information to a smartphone. The wireless wearable sensor was attached on the midway of the xiphoid process and the costal margin, corresponding to the abdomen-apposed rib cage, based on the anatomical and experimental analysis. The sensor, with a footprint of 40 × 35 × 6 mm3 and weighing 6.5 g, including a 2.7 g battery, consists of three subsystems, (i) ultrasound emitter, (ii) ultrasound receiver, and (iii) data acquisition and wireless transmitter. The sensor converts the linear strain at the wearing site to the lung volume change by measuring the change in ultrasound pressure as a function of the distance between the emitter and the receiver. The temporal lung volume change data, directly converted from the ultrasound pressure, is wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone where a custom-designed app computes to show volume-time and flow rate-volume loop graphs, standard respiratory analysis plots. The app analyzes the plots to show the clinically relevant respiratory behavioral parameters, such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume delivered in the first second (FEV1). Potential user-induced error on sensor placement and temperature sensitivity were studied to demonstrate the sensor maintains its performance within a reasonable range of those variables. Eight volunteers were recruited to evaluate the sensor, which showed the mean deviation of the FEV1/FVC ratio in the range of 0.00–4.25\% when benchmarked by the spirometer. The continuous measurement of respiratory behavioral parameters helps track the progression of the respiratory diseases, including asthma progression to provide alerts to relevant caregivers to seek needed timely treatment.},

	abstract = {The main goal of the research presented in this paper was to develop a refined machine learning algorithm for industrial tomography applications. The article presents algorithms based on logistic regression in relation to image reconstruction using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and ultrasound transmission tomography (UST). The test object was a tank filled with water in which reconstructed objects were placed. For both EIT and UST, a novel approach was used in which each pixel of the output image was reconstructed by a separately trained prediction system. Therefore, it was necessary to use many predictive systems whose number corresponds to the number of pixels of the output image. Thanks to this approach the under-completed problem was changed to an over-completed one. To reduce the number of predictors in logistic regression by removing irrelevant and mutually correlated entries, the elastic net method was used. The developed algorithm that reconstructs images pixel-by-pixel is insensitive to the shape, number and position of the reconstructed objects. In order to assess the quality of mappings obtained thanks to the new algorithm, appropriate metrics were used: compatibility ratio (CR) and relative error (RE). The obtained results enabled the assessment of the usefulness of logistic regression in the reconstruction of EIT and UST images.},

Ultrasound imaging is portable and universally safe, but existing modalities cannot image usefully inside the adult human skull. We use in silico simulations to demonstrate that full-waveform inversion, a computational technique originally developed in geophysics, is able to generate accurate three-dimensional images of the brain with sub-millimetre resolution. This approach overcomes the familiar problems of conventional ultrasound neuroimaging by using the following: transcranial ultrasound that is not obscured by strong reflections from the skull, low frequencies that are readily transmitted with good signal-to-noise ratio, an accurate wave equation that properly accounts for the physics of wave propagation, and adaptive waveform inversion that is able to create an accurate model of the skull that then compensates properly for wavefront distortion. Laboratory ultrasound data, using ex vivo human skulls and in vivo transcranial signals, demonstrate that our computational experiments mimic the penetration and signal-to-noise ratios expected in clinical applications. This form of non-invasive neuroimaging has the potential for the rapid diagnosis of stroke and head trauma, and for the provision of routine monitoring of a wide range of neurological conditions.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonography is a widely used imaging modality to visualize anatomical structures due to its low cost and ease of use; however, it is challenging to acquire acceptable image quality in deep tissue. Synthetic aperture (SA) is a technique used to increase image resolution by synthesizing information from multiple subapertures, but the resolution improvement is limited by the physical size of the array transducer. With a large F-number, it is difficult to achieve high resolution in deep regions without extending the effective aperture size. We propose a method to extend the available aperture size for SA—called synthetic tracked aperture ultrasound (STRATUS) imaging—by sweeping an ultrasound transducer while tracking its orientation and location. Tracking information of the ultrasound probe is used to synthesize the signals received at different positions. Considering the practical implementation, we estimated the effect of tracking and ultrasound calibration error to the quality of the final beamformed image through simulation. In addition, to experimentally validate this approach, a 6 degree-of-freedom robot arm was used as a mechanical tracker to hold an ultrasound transducer and to apply in-plane lateral translational motion. Results indicate that STRATUS imaging with robotic tracking has the potential to improve ultrasound image quality.},

	abstract = {Lumbar punctures (LPs) are interventional procedures used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a bodily fluid needed to diagnose central nervous system disorders. Most lumbar punctures are performed blindly without imaging guidance. Because the target window is small, physicians can only accurately palpate the appropriate space about 30\% of the time and perform a successful procedure after an average of three attempts. Although various forms of imaging based guidance systems have been developed to aid in this procedure, these systems complicate the procedure by including independent image modalities and requiring image-to-needle registration to guide the needle insertion. Here, we propose a simple and direct needle insertion platform utilizing a single ultrasound element within the needle through dynamic sensing and imaging. The needle-shaped ultrasound transducer can not only sense the distance between the tip and a potential obstacle such as bone, but also visually locate structures by combining transducer location tracking and back projection based tracked synthetic aperture beam-forming algorithm. The concept of the system was validated through simulation first, which revealed the tolerance to realistic error. Then, the initial prototype of the single element transducer was built into a 14G needle, and was mounted on a holster equipped with a rotation tracking encoder. We experimentally evaluated the system using a metal wire phantom mimicking high reflection bone structures and an actual spine bone phantom with both the controlled motion and freehand scanning.

	abstract = {Current standard workflows of ultrasound (US)-guided needle insertion require physicians to use their both hands: holding the US probe to locate interested areas with the non-dominant hand and the needle with the dominant hand. This is due to the separation of functionalities for localization and needle insertion. This requirement does not only make the procedure cumbersome, but also limits the reliability of guidance given that the positional relationship between the needle and US images is interpreted with their experience and assumption. Although the US-guided needle insertion may be assisted through navigation systems, the recovery of the positional relationship between the needle and US images requires the usage of external tracking systems and image-based tracking algorisms that may involve the registration inaccuracy. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the solution that provides a simple and intuitive needle localization and insertion to improve the conventional US-guided procedure. In this work, we propose a new device concept based on the ring-arrayed forward-viewing (RAF) ultrasound imaging system. The proposed system is comprised with ring-arrayed transducers and an open whole inside the ring where the needle can be inserted. The ring array provides forward-viewing US images, where the needle can be visualized at the center of the reconstructed image without any registration. As the proof of concept, we designed several ring-arrayed configurations and visualized point targets using the forward-viewing US imaging through simulations and phantom experiments. The results demonstrated the successful target visualization and indicates the ring-arrayed US imaging has a potential to improve the US-guided needle insertion procedure to be simpler and more intuitive.},

As some examples, we outline efficient and effective deep learning solutions for adaptive beamforming and adaptive spectral Doppler through artificial agents, learn compressive encodings for color Doppler, and provide a framework for structured signal recovery by learning fast approximations of iterative minimization problems, with applications to clutter suppression and super-resolution ultrasound.

Using the scanning transducer, 3D pulse-echo ultrasound imaging of two silicon discs immersed in water as the imaging target was successfully conducted. The lateral resolution of the 3D ultrasound image was further improved with the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT).

The intrinsic dynamic structural filtering due to significantly different resonance frequencies of the two scanning axes was used to suppress their mechanical coupling and therefore allow independent control of the two scanning motions. For verification, a prototype micro scanning mirror was designed, fabricated and tested. The resonance frequencies of the fast and slow axes in air and water were 720/72 Hz and 690/55 Hz, respectively. The optical tilting angles of both fast and slow axes at the resonance frequencies were characterized, showing good linearity with the amplitude of the driving current. With both axes driven simultaneously, stable and repeatable 2D raster scanning was achieved in both air and water. By tuning the phase differences between the fast- and slow-axis driving currents to shift the raster scanning paths, 2D B-mode and 3D ultrasound microscopic imaging with increased density of image ‘pixels’ were also demonstrated.},

Unique advantages of AR-PM are its non-invasive, non-ionizing real-time, and deeper imaging depth. AR-PAM typically uses an ultrasound transducer with a high acoustic numerical aperture (NA) to enable deeper imaging depth. While high NA achieves good lateral resolution in the focal plane but significantly degrades the lateral resolution in the out-of-focus region. Synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) has been introduced to overcome this out-of-focus degradation by synthesizing the correlated signals. Several 2-D SAFTs have been also reported to improve degraded resolution in all directions. However, the resolution enhancement of the previously reported 2-D SAFTs are suboptimal and are not equivalent to the 1-D SAFT performance under an ideal condition with the sample orientation perpendicular to the synthetic aperture direction. In this paper, we present a new 2-D SAFT called 2-D directional SAFT that improves the lateral resolution significantly and we compare our results against 1-D SAFT under ideal condition. We applied this algorithm to phantom and in vivo images to show the improvement in image quality. We also implement this algorithm in a graphical processing unit to achieve high performance to show the practicality of implementing this new algorithm in a system.},

Typical probes for use in colorectal ultrasonic imaging applications are developed for surgeons to diagnose and stage rectal tumors and image the rectum and anus. Here we outline a new technique and use it for colorectal imaging in an animal. This technique involves use of an ultrasound array module positioned along the axis of rotation such that improved rotation is possible. This module is in the shape of a linear rod with a rotary linear component that allows for emission of focused ultrasonic echo signals from a linear section of the probe. The usability of the transducer and rectal image quality are satisfactory in a porcine model with the technique proposed here, axial/lateral resolution as 0.96/2.24 mm with 6 dB applied through the contour map using the point spread function. When compared to currently available methods, this technique provides superior diagnostic 3D volumetric image quality with reduced acquisition time.

To achieve B-mode imaging, conventional approaches adapt mechanical linear or sector scanning methods. However, due to its low scanning speed, mechanical linear scanning cannot achieve acceptable temporal resolution for real-time imaging, and the sector scanning method requires specialized low-load transducers that are small and lightweight. Here, we present a novel single-element US imaging system based on an acoustic mirror scanning method. Instead of physically moving the US transducer, the acoustic path is quickly steered by a water-proofed microelectromechanical (MEMS) scanner, achieving real-time imaging. Taking advantage of the low-cost and compact MEMS scanner, we implemented both a tabletop system for in vivo small animal imaging and a handheld system for in vivo human imaging. Notably, in combination with mechanical raster scanning, we could acquire the volumetric US images in live animals. This versatile US imaging system can be potentially used for various preclinical and clinical applications, including echocardiography, ophthalmic imaging, and ultrasound-guided catheterization.},

However, due to acoustic diffraction, the ability to focus an ultrasound beam is limited which leads to low spatial and contrast resolutions. We aim to propose a new method wherein the array elements are simultaneously excited with signals coded with random sequences, which yields an unfocused ultrasound wavefront of random interference. When such a wavefront propagates through the medium, its energy reflects back from the tissue, causing individual scatterers to have unique impulse responses. In such a case, we can reconstruct high-resolution ultrasound images using a priori measurements of spatial impulse responses and the l1 norm minimization algorithm. In a simulation study, we achieved a spatial resolution of 0.25 mm, which constitutes a four-fold improvement over conventional methods that use delay-and-sum beamforming. In the experimental study, we demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed interference-based method using a tissue-mimicking phantom with 0.1-mm- and 0.08- mm-diameter nylon wires.},

	abstract = {Accurate body-composition measurements are important for diagnosing health status. Devices used for body-composition measurement should be easily accessible for patient diagnosis whilst realizing high inter- and intra-operator accuracies for repetitive measurements. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been considered as a gold-standard method. However, these methods have disadvantages such as limited accessibility, high costs, and long scanning times. Ultrasound imaging is an alternative technique for body-composition measurement owing to its easy accessibility and convenience of use. Current ultrasound imaging techniques identify the interface between different tissue layers based on echogenicity changes observed in ultrasound images. Their measurement accuracies, therefore, depend on the ultrasound image quality and operator interpretation. Radio-frequency (RF) signals obtained directly from an ultrasound system ensure the reproducibility of measurements. However, RF signals contain substantial noise, and signal processing is fundamental in body-composition measurements. This study proposes an ultrasound signal processing technique to measure body composition. Backscattered RF signals in ex vivo swine-tissue samples were first acquired from an ultrasound system. Subsequently, interfaces of subcutaneous-fat, muscle, and bone were identified during RF signal processing. Next, subcutaneous-fat and muscle thicknesses were calculated based on the speed of sound through tissue. Lastly, the subcutaneous-fat and muscle thicknesses measured using ultrasound signals were validated using MRI scans. A strong linear correlation was observed between the proposed ultrasound method and MRI. Thickness correlations between ultrasound and MRI were observed to be 0.899 and 0.982 for subcutaneous-fat and muscle, respectively. The proposed technique, therefore, demonstrates clinical potential for body-composition measurements.},

	abstract = {The biomechanical properties of soft tissues vary with pathological phenomenon. Ultrasound elasticity imaging is a noninvasive method used to analyze the local biomechanical properties of soft tissues in clinical diagnosis. However, the echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) is diminished because of the attenuation of ultrasonic energy by soft tissues. Therefore, to improve the quality of elastography, the eSNR and depth of ultrasound penetration must be increased using chirp-coded excitation. Moreover, the low axial resolution of ultrasound images generated by a chirp-coded pulse must be increased using an appropriate compression filter. The main aim of this study is to develop an ultrasound elasticity imaging system with chirp-coded excitation using a Tukey window for assessing the biomechanical properties of soft tissues. In this study, we propose an ultrasound elasticity imaging system equipped with a 7.5-MHz single-element transducer and polymethylpentene compression plate to measure strains in soft tissues. Soft tissue strains were analyzed using cross correlation (CC) and absolution difference (AD) algorithms. The optimal parameters of CC and AD algorithms used for the ultrasound elasticity imaging system with chirp-coded excitation were determined by measuring the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) of a homogeneous phantom. Moreover, chirp-coded excitation and short pulse excitation were used to measure the elasticity properties of the phantom. The elastographic qualities of the tissue-mimicking phantom were assessed in terms of Young’s modulus and elastographic contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRe). The results show that the developed ultrasound elasticity imaging system with chirp-coded excitation modulated by a Tukey window can acquire accurate, high-quality elastography images.},

	abstract = {A shortcoming of current prosthetic technology is the quality of afferent feedback to the user. Modern neural interfaces for powered prosthetic limbs do not provide their users with proprioception, the sense of the position of their limbs in space. This could be achieved by stimulating residual muscles, which contain sensory receptors that are used for proprioception. This scheme requires measurements of muscle length, velocity, and electrical activation in order to provide feedback control for the stimulation. These measurements can also be used to interpret the user's intent for movement of their prosthesis. However, no such hardware exists that is portable, low-power, and that includes functionality for muscle stimulation, length measurement, velocity measurement, and measurement of electrical activity. In this thesis, I designed and built a collection of circuitry for interfacing with muscle through various sensors and stimulation techniques in order to provide this functionality. This system may be used by researchers for taking measurements to deduce muscle state and for closed-loop functional stimulation of muscles. The system includes modules for sonomicrometry, electromyography, and functional electrical stimulation. For each module, the thesis discusses comparable devices, the theory of operation of the device, the design considerations, and and relevant results.},

	abstract = {The electric power generation and oil/gas production industries have a strong interest in the physical characterization of conducting and non-conducting liquid films that are formed during the flow of liquids in pipes. Conducting and non-conducting liquid films do not lend themselves to the same characterization techniques due to the different requirements originating from their electrical properties. Techniques based on the use of ultrasound are extremely attractive for that purpose as they do not depend on the electrical properties of the liquid and are also non-invasive. This paper presents the application of ultrasonic techniques for measuring the thickness of wavy thin liquid films ({\textless}6 mm) in vertical pipes. Initial benchtop experiments were performed, and different signal processing methods were implemented in order to identify the most suitable depending on the film thickness. For a film thickness {\textgreater}0.5 mm a time of flight method was utilized whereas for a film thicknesses {\textless}0.5 mm a frequency method and time domain method were utilized. These methods were validated using a theoretical volume measurement on a static system. The studied methods were then tested on downward and upward vertical flow experimental rigs with pipe diameters of 127 mm and 34.5 mm respectively. The results of the experiments using ultrasonic methods showed good agreement with the measurements obtained using a multi pin film sensor and a concentric conductance probe, highlighting the potential that ultrasound offers in thin film measurements.},

Real-time, in-line sensors are required for monitoring, and subsequently optimising, essential processes such as mixing. Ultrasonic sensors are low-cost, real-time, in-line, and applicable to characterise opaque systems. In this study, a non-invasive, reflection-mode ultrasonic measurement technique was used to monitor two model mixing systems. The two systems studied were honey-water blending and flour-water batter mixing. Classification machine learning models were developed to predict if materials were mixed or not mixed. Regression machine learning models were developed to predict the time remaining until mixing completion. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, long short-term memory neural networks, and convolutional neural networks were tested, along with different methods for engineering features from ultrasonic waveforms in both the time and frequency domain. Comparisons between using a single sensor and performing multisensor data fusion between two sensors were made. Classification accuracies of up to 96.3\% for honey-water blending and 92.5\% for flour-water batter mixing were achieved, along with R2 values for the regression models of up to 0.977 for honey-water blending and 0.968 for flour-water batter mixing. Each prediction task produced optimal performance with different algorithms and feature engineering methods, vindicating the extensive comparison between different machine learning approaches.},

It was recently proven that ultrasound echoes reflected from the interface between a transmitting medium and the cement paste carry information about the status of the chemical process responsible of the cement hardening. In application like e.g. the monitoring of bridges or tunnels during construction, these sensors should be deployed in remote sites where they should work autonomously for days. Unfortunately, no electronics is currently available which satisfies the requirements for an industrial use. In this paper a completely configurable, embedded ultrasound system, capable of managing up to 8 ultrasound transducers, is presented. The proposed “smart” sensor can be remotely controlled through a web-based user-friendly interface, is portable, and can be programmed to perform a series of tests scheduled along days or months.

	abstract = {Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurements of trabecular bone are a useful tool for the assessment of osteoporotic fracture risk. However, cortical bone properties (e.g. porosity) have an impact on bone strength as well and thus current research is focused on QUS assessment of cortical bone properties. Simulation studies of ultrasound propagation through cortical bone indicate that anisotropy, calculated from the ratio of the velocities in axial and tangential directions, is correlated with porosity. However, this relationship is affected by error sources, specifically bone surface curvature and variability of probe positioning. With the aim of in vivo estimation of cortical porosity a new ultrasound device was developed, which sequentially measures velocities in 3 different directions (axial=0° and ±37.5°) using the axial transmission method. Measurements on planar porosity phantoms (0–25\%) were performed to confirm the results of the afore mentioned simulation studies. Additionally, measurements on cylindrical phantoms without pores (min. radius=34mm for strongest curvature) were performed to estimate the influence of surface curvature on velocity measurements (the tibia bone surface is fairly flat but may show surface curvature in some patients). The velocities in the axial and ±37.5° directions were used to calculate an anisotropy index. The velocities measured on the porosity phantoms showed a decrease by −6.3±0.2m/s and −10.1±0.2m/s per percent increase in porosity in axial and ±37.5° directions, respectively. Surface curvature had an effect on the velocities measured in ±37.5° directions which could be minimized by a correction algorithm resulting in an error of 5m/s. The anisotropy index could be used to estimate porosity with an accuracy error of 1.5\%. These results indicate that an estimation of porosity using velocity measurements in different directions might be feasible, even in bones with curved surface. These results obtained on phantom material indicate that the approach tested may be suited for porosity measurements on human tibia bone.},

	abstract = {Flow batteries using suspension electrodes are currently investigated due to their potentially high energy densities and individual scalability of capacity and power density. In contrast to batteries with statically contacted electrodes or conventional redox flow batteries, their performance depend significantly on the local flow conditions of the electrode suspension in the electrochemical cell. Hence, it is crucial to understand and model the complex flow characteristics of such solid-liquid suspensions. Detailed ultrasound flow measurements are combined with multidimensional modeling of the bulk rheology and wall interactions for opaque, thixotropic multiphase fluids in a real-world flow setup. The present flow investigations are conducted for zinc-air type of batteries using a gelled alkaline electrolyte with suspended microscopic zinc particles, however the utilized methods could be adapted to other complex suspension flows of interest. Due to the opacity of the suspension, an ultrasound flow mapping technique, the ultrasound imaging velocimetry (UIV), was applied. In a reference measurement using the model fluid glycerol, the UIV is validated by comparing the measured flow field to optical particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and a numerical simulation. In contrast to a Newtonian fluid, the gelled suspension with 8 vol.\% particle loading exhibits significant time-dependent non-Newtonian flow characteristics with slip at the wall. While initially strongly sheared zones retain a comparatively low viscosity and allow for high velocity gradients, in areas with low initial shearing (e.g. in corners) the fluid structure is able to rebuild, resulting in a solid-like behavior. An in-depth understanding of the development and the extent of such zero-flow zones can be critical for reliable and efficient designs of the relevant fluidic structures. The measurement data of the zinc-electrolyte suspension flow were used as reference to estimate parameters for a computational fluid dynamics model considering the time-dependent, non-Newtonian rheology of the bulk fluid and the apparent slip at the walls. The simulation model is able to predict the main characteristics of the measured two-dimensional flow fields. Despite some uncertainties, the methods prove to be effective for investigating complex suspension flows and they can be applied to improve and optimize the corresponding fluidic structures, either in flow batteries with flowing suspension electrodes or other industrial applications, including the processing of polymers, minerals, cosmetics, food products, pharmaceuticals and ceramics.},

The usage of single mode waveguides overcomes the problem of overheating the transducers, but requires a mechanical scanning for imaging. A multimode waveguide can carry the information of an image, but a scrambling of the signals occurs due to multiple reflections at the waveguide's boundaries. We propose a new approach to overcome the scrambling and enable flow imaging through a short waveguide: the time-reversal virtual array (TRVA) method. The time invariance of the wave equation in a linear medium allows the refocusing on a limited set of calibrated points, which form the virtual array. This virtual array can conceptually be treated as a phased array. In this paper, the TRVA has been characterized theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. For the first time, a planar velocity measurement of a rotating flow in liquid gallium-indium-tin is demonstrated through a borosilicate waveguide at room temperature.

	abstract = {Understanding the complex interaction of conductive fluids and time-varying magnetic fields is the main goal of research in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Customized magnetic fields can be used to optimize flows in technical and industrial processes involving liquid metals. For example the performance of batteries with replaceable liquid electrolytes, such as zinc slurry energy storage systems, can be improved by magnetically influencing the flow of the electrolyte. However, necessary experimental studies are often limited by the performance of flow instrumentation for opaque liquids. We present a modular research platform for flow mapping in liquid metals, the phased array ultrasound Doppler velocimeter (PAUDV). It is based on the pulsed-wave ultrasound Doppler principle in combination with the phased array technique to provide an electrically steerable sound field, enabling novel applications in MHD research. The ability to dynamically focus the ultrasound beam allows to resolve smaller flow structures in planar measurements compared to fixed-beam sensors. The PAUDV can be applied to flows in narrow channels and two velocity components can be measured with only one acoustical access via the cross beam technique. Fast electrical traversing of the measurement volume allows to obtain and visualize turbulence statistics. A two-point correlation function can be retrieved by interleaving velocity measurements at two focal points of varying distance. The PAUDV consists of a modular electronics unit with up to eight beamformer cards, capable of driving a total of 256 channels. Each channel can be individually configured regarding the excitation pattern (three-level quantization, 64 samples) and the delay (1.6 ns resolution). Data acquisition and processing is implemented on multiple FPGAs, control and data visualization are performed on a PC. The capabilities of the modular research platform PAUDV are demonstrated on measurements in the alloy gallium-indium-tin at room temperature. Time resolved planar velocity vector maps are shown for a flow in a cubic vessel under the influence of a transient rotation magnetic field.},

The experimental proof of concept is performed with ultrasonic waves, but this approach can be applied to any field of wave physics for which multielement technology is available. The concept is that focused beam forming enables the synthesis, in transmit and receive, of an array of virtual transducers which map the entire medium to be imaged. The interelement responses of this virtual array form a focused reflection matrix from which spatial maps of various characteristics of the propagating wave can be retrieved. Here we demonstrate (i) a local focusing criterion that enables the image quality and the wave velocity to be evaluated everywhere inside the medium, including in random speckle, and (ii) a highly resolved spatial mapping of the prevalence of multiple scattering, which constitutes a new and unique contrast for ultrasonic imaging. The approach is demonstrated for a controllable phantom system and for in vivo imaging of the human abdomen. More generally, this matrix approach opens an original and powerful route for quantitative imaging in wave physics.},

To enable a wider application of OPT, we present OptiJ, a low-cost, fully open-source OPT system capable of imaging large transparent specimens up to 13 mm tall and 8 mm deep with 50 µm resolution. OptiJ is based on off-the-shelf, easy-to-assemble optical components and an ImageJ plugin library for OPT data reconstruction. The software includes novel correction routines for uneven illumination and sample jitter in addition to CPU/GPU accelerated reconstruction for large datasets. We demonstrate the use of OptiJ to image and reconstruct cleared lung lobes from adult mice. We provide a detailed set of instructions to set up and use the OptiJ framework. Our hardware and software design are modular and easy to implement, allowing for further open microscopy developments for imaging large organ samples.},

	abstract = {A wireless electrical stimulation implant for peripheral nerves, achieving {\textgreater}10× improvement over state of the art in the depth/volume figure of merit, is presented. The fully integrated implant measures just 2 mm × 3 mm × 6.5 mm (39 mm3, 78 mg), and operates at a large depth of 10.5 cm in a tissue phantom. The implant is powered using ultrasound and includes a miniaturized piezoelectric receiver (piezo), an IC designed in 180 nm HV BCD process, an off-chip energy storage capacitor, and platinum stimulation electrodes. The package also includes an optional blue light-emitting diode for potential applications in optogenetic stimulation in the future. A system-level design strategy for complete operation of the implant during the charging transient of the storage capacitor, as well as a unique downlink command/data transfer protocol, is presented. The implant enables externally programmable current-controlled stimulation of peripheral nerves, with a wide range of stimulation parameters, both for electrical (22 to 5000 μA amplitude, 14 to 470 μs pulse-width, 0 to 60 Hz repetition rate) and optical (up to 23 mW/mm2 optical intensity) stimulation. Additionally, the implant achieves 15 V compliance voltage for chronic applications. Full integration of the implant components, end-to-end in vitro system characterizations, and results for the electrical stimulation of a sciatic nerve, demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed stimulator for peripheral nerves.},

In particular, we propose an ultra-miniature as well as extremely compliant system that enables massive scaling in the number of neural recordings from the brain while providing a path towards truly chronic BMI. These goals are achieved via two fundamental technology innovations: 1) thousands of 10 - 100 {\textbackslash}mu m scale, free-floating, independent sensor nodes, or neural dust, that detect and report local extracellular electrophysiological data, and 2) a sub-cranial interrogator that establishes power and communication links with the neural dust.},

Current approaches to interfacing with peripheral nerves and muscles rely heavily on wires, creating problems for chronic use, while emerging wireless approaches lack the size scalability necessary to interrogate small-diameter nerves. Furthermore, conventional electrode-based technologies lack the capability to record from nerves with high spatial resolution or to record independently from many discrete sites within a nerve bundle. Here, we demonstrate neural dust, a wireless and scalable ultrasonic backscatter system for powering and communicating with implanted bioelectronics. We show that ultrasound is effective at delivering power to mm-scale devices in tissue; likewise, passive, battery-less communication using backscatter enables high-fidelity transmission of electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram (ENG) signals from anesthetized rats.

This allows a reduction in size and power consumption of the front-end electronics with only a minor loss in image quality. We demonstrate an 8-fold receive channel count reduction with a 3.16 dB and 3.64 dB mean absolute error for gallbladder and kidney images, respectively, as well as 7.4\% increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio for kidney images and 0.1\% loss in the contrast-to noise ratio for gallbladder images, on average.

As ultrasound imaging transitions from 2D to 3D, the massive data bandwidth and billions of trigonometric operations required to reconstruct each volume leaves conventional computer architectures falling short. Despite recent algorithmic improvements, high-volume-rate ultrasound imaging remains computationally infeasible on known platforms. In this article, we expand our previous work on Tetris, a novel hardware accelerator for separable ultrasound beamforming that enables volume acquisition rates up to the physics limits of acoustic propagation delay. Through algorithmic and hardware optimizations, we enable an image reconstruction system design outclassing previously proposed accelerators in performance while lowering hardware complexity, storage, and power requirements. Tetris operates in a streaming fashion—without requiring on-chip storage of the entire receive signal—reconstructing volumes in real-time. For a representative imaging task, our proposed system generates physics-limited 13,000 volumes per second in a 2 watt power budget. The Tetris beamformer has an unprecedented power efficiency of 2.03 tera-beamforming operations per watt—an increase in efficiency of nearly 3× compared to the prior work.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental theorem in information theory is the so-called sampling theorem also known as Shannon-Nyquist theorem. This theorem aims at giving the minimal frequency needed to sample and reconstruct perfectly an analog band-limited signal. Compressive sensing (or compressed sensing, compressive sampling) or CS in short is a recent theory that allows, if the signal to be reconstructed satisfies a number of conditions, to decrease the amount of data needed to reconstruct the signal. As a result this theory can be used for at least two purposes: i) accelerate the acquisition rate without decreasing the reconstructed signal quality (e.g. in terms of resolution, SNR, contrast ...) ii) improve the image quality without increasing the quantity of needed data. Even if medical ultrasound is a domain where several potential applications can be highlighted, the use of this theory in this domain is extremely recent. In this paper we review the basic theory of compressive sensing. Then, a review of the existing CS studies in the field of medical ultrasound is given: reconstruction of sparse scattering maps, pre-beamforming channel data, post-beamforming signals and slow time Doppler data. Finally the open problems and challenges to be tackled in order to make the application of CS to medical US a reality will be given.},

	abstract = {Miniature ultrasound probes, such as the intra-cardiac echography (ICE) probe shown in Fig. 23.6.1, increasingly employ in-probe ASICs to interface with the elements of an ultrasound transducer array to improve signal quality and reduce cable count [1]-[4]. For each transducer element, such an ASIC contains a pulser that drives the element to generate a pressure wave, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) that amplifies the resulting echo signal, and a time-gain compensation (TGC) circuit that compensates for the time-varying echo-signal amplitude due to propagation attenuation of the acoustic wave. Without TGC, the first echoes, from shallow tissue, are much larger than later echoes from deeper tissue. The TGC circuit corrects for this, ideally by providing a gain that increases exponentially with time, thus reducing the dynamic range (DR) by as much as 40dB and strongly relaxing the requirements of subsequent blocks. In conventional ultrasound systems, TGC is typically performed after the LNA, implying that a power-hungry LNA is required that can handle the full DR of the echo signal [5], [6]. In recent in-probe ASICs, programmable-gain LNAs have been employed that provide a step-wise TGC approximation [1]-[3]. While this saves power, the associated gain-switching transients lead to imaging artefacts. In this paper, we present an LNA with a built-in continuous TGC function that mitigates this problem. The LNA is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) optimized to amplify the signal current of a capacitive micro-machined ultrasound transducer (CMUT). We demonstrate its integration into a 64-channel ASIC for a CMUT-based ICE probe.},

	abstract = {This thesis is focused on the development of ultrasonic devices for industrial non-destructive testing (NDT). Ultrasound is generated from mechanical vibrations and then propagates through the medium. Ultrasonic devices can make use of the ultrasound in both aspects, vibrations and propagations, to perform inspections of the objects. To this end, two devices were developed in this research, each pertaining to NDT of the objects. 
The first device is the vibro-tactile sensor which aims to estimate the elastic modules of soft materials with minimally invasive technique. Inspired by load sensitivity studies in the high-power ultrasonic applications, vibration characteristics in resonance were utilized to perform the inspection. Only a minimal force to ensure contact with the object surface needs to be applied for a vibro-tactile sensor to perform inspection of the object; hence, it can be used for in-vivo measurement of the soft materials’ elastic moduli without causing severe surface deformation. The design and analysis of the device were carried out using the electro-mechanical analogy to address the electro-mechanical nature of piezoelectric devices. The designed vibro-tactile sensor resonates at {\textasciitilde}40 kHz and can be applied to differentiate the elastic modulus of isotropic soft samples with a range from 10 kPa to 70 kPa. 
The second device developed is a field-programmable development platform for ultrasonic pulse-echo testing. Ultrasonic testing, utilizing sound wave propagation, is a widely used technique in the industry. The commercially available equipment for industrial NDT is highly dependent on the competence of the inspector and rarely provides the access to raw data. For successful transition from traditional labor-intensive manufacturing to the next generation “smart factory” where intelligent machines replace human labor, inspection equipment with automated in-line data collection and processing capability is highly needed. To this end, a flexible platform which provides the access to raw data for algorithm development and implementation should be established. Therefore, an affordable, versatile, and researcher-friendly development platform based on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) was developed in the research. Both hardware and software development tools and procedures were discussed. In the lab experiment, the developed prototype exhibited its competence in NDT applications and successfully carried out hardware-based auto-detection algorithm for mm-level defects on steel and aluminum specimens. Comparisons with commercial systems were provided to guide future development.},

	abstract = {This thesis details non-invasive evaluation of a central arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform using a low-cost ultrasound scanning system. ABP bears significant clinical value in cardiovascular pathophysiology. Non-invasive evaluation of the full ABP waveform has been long desired by medical communities due to its anticipated opportunities to greatly enhance cardiovascular patient care. In addition, central ABP has been focused on because of its close association with the adverse outcomes of cardiovascular events. This work mainly explores monitoring of carotid arterial pulsation and local pulse wave velocity (PWV) by the designed system to estimate the ABP waveform, conducting simultaneous spectral Doppler and M-mode imaging. The system is characterized in electrical and acoustic domains to preserve adequate signal integrity to faithfully extract a spatial mean flow velocity and an arterial distension waveform. The carotid ABP waveform is estimated from the distension waveform and the local PWV with one-time calibration from an arterial-line (A-line) or a volume clamping method. The proof-of-concept study demonstrated that the carotid ABP waveform estimation is feasible. The pulse pressure estimation compared to a sphygmomanometer and a finger ABP waveform differ by 1.49±11.7 and -4.92±12.9 mmHg, respectively. The designed and characterized motion-tolerant ultrasonography extends tolerable lateral offsets up to ±8 mm while limiting error of the flow and distension waveforms within about 5\%. The system is also validated under hemodynamic stress of the Valsalva maneuver and in intensive care settings compared to the A-line. This thesis demonstrates the profound potential for a portable low-cost ultrasound system toward non-invasive evaluation of a central ABP waveform in clinically relevant settings.},

	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/26344},
	abstract = {Logging While Drilling (LWD) instruments used in oil and gas exploration are subjected to extreme environmental conditions that make reliable operation a major challenge. The sensors directly exposed to this environment experience accelerated aging and may suffer physical damage leading to failure. The cost of drilling and rig operations is very high magnifying any failures or issues with LWD tools. The goal of this report is to present a built-in self-test for an instrument sensor that provides a means to evaluate sensor functionality. The sensor is a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer. A brief review of the sensor physics will be given. I will review some methods for characterizing piezoelectric ceramic materials and transducers. The application of sensor test methods is applied in an ultrasound pulse-echo application. A brief review of the application circuit will be covered including state of the art in commercial ultrasound integrated circuit design. A prototype of the BIST method is evaluated using test transducers to verify the circuit provides indication of a transducers ability to function correctly. The prototype is achieved through the AD5933 demo board and MATLAB is used for data processing.},

Here, we report a novel ultrasonic imaging device that can optically display an acoustic signal on the surface of a piezoelectric transducer. By fabricating an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) on top of a piezoelectric crystal, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), an acousto-optical piezoelectric OLED (p-OLED) transducer is realized, converting an acoustic wave profile directly to an optical image. Because of the integrated device architecture, the resulting p-OLED features a high acousto-optic conversion efficiency at the resonance frequency, providing a piezoelectric field to drive the OLED. By incorporating an electrode array in the p-OLED, we demonstrate a novel tomographic ultrasound imaging device that is operated without a need for conventional signal processing.},

The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implants is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications. This platform can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implants and wearable devices. We demonstrate that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers, the attenuation of 2.4 GHz RF is substantially greater than ultrasound, e.g., ultrasound attenuates 70 dB less than RF at distances over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires significantly less transmission power than 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability, e.g., 35 dBm less at distances over 12 cm with 10-3 Bit Error Rate (BER) thus enabling a lower energy per bit and a longer device lifetime. Finally, we experimentally establish 2.4 GHz RF links do not function at distances greater than 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10-6 BER up to a distance of 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.},

	doi = {10.1109/TAEE46915.2020.9163730},
	abstract = {The practical implementation of digital systems during the lab sessions of an undergraduate digital electronics course can be done using monolithic integrated circuits such as the TTL 7400 or CMOS 4000 series and breadboard wires to connect them into a protoboard, or using reconfigurable hardware devices such as the FPGAs. In the first approach, many students face difficulties in the wiring and testing processes due to the large number of wired connections that must be carried out, while in the second approach difficulties arise with the limited or restricted access that students have in order to use the software and hardware development tools needed to program the FPGAs. Frequently, in many schools of engineering and faculties, these tools are only available during the lab sessions and, after finishing each session, they are usually stored with no free access to them. Thus, students cannot practice freely to improve their digital electronics knowledge and skills. In order to try to overcome both problems, this work presents a low-cost development platform to design digital circuits on FPGAs that: 1) is easily replicable, 2) the number of wired connections is minimized, and 3) is based on the use of open-source software and hardware tools. Using such approach, students are able to work at home on the lab exercises before coming to the lab. Thus, during the lab sessions they can deepen the fundamental aspects of digital electronics instead of being focused on solving wiring mistakes.},

This essay introduces the term hardware lottery to describe when a research idea wins because it is suited to the available software and hardware and not because the idea is superior to alternative research directions. Examples from early computer science history illustrate how hardware lotteries can delay research progress by casting successful ideas as failures. These lessons are particularly salient given the advent of domain specialized hardware which makes it increasingly costly to stray off of the beaten path of research ideas.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound detectors use high-frequency sound waves to image objects and measure distances, but the resolution of these readings is limited by the physical dimensions of the detecting element. Point-like broadband ultrasound detection can greatly increase the resolution of ultrasonography and optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging1,2, but current ultrasound detectors, such as those used for medical imaging, cannot be miniaturized sufficiently. Piezoelectric transducers lose sensitivity quadratically with size reduction3, and optical microring resonators4 and Fabry–Pérot etalons5 cannot adequately confine light to dimensions smaller than about 50 micrometres. Micromachining methods have been used to generate arrays of capacitive6 and piezoelectric7 transducers, but with bandwidths of only a few megahertz and dimensions exceeding 70 micrometres. Here we use the widely available silicon-on-insulator technology to develop a miniaturized ultrasound detector, with a sensing area of only 220 nanometres by 500 nanometres. The silicon-on-insulator-based optical resonator design provides per-area sensitivity that is 1,000 times higher than that of microring resonators and 100,000,000 times better than that of piezoelectric detectors. Our design also enables an ultrawide detection bandwidth, reaching 230 megahertz at −6 decibels. In addition to making the detectors suitable for manufacture in very dense arrays, we show that the submicrometre sensing area enables super-resolution detection and imaging performance. We demonstrate imaging of features 50 times smaller than the wavelength of ultrasound detected. Our detector enables ultra-miniaturization of ultrasound readings, enabling ultrasound imaging at a resolution comparable to that achieved with optical microscopy, and potentially enabling the development of very dense ultrasound arrays on a silicon chip.},

It contributes to the formation of a recognisable identity and enables interactions with a wider community. This article reviews past and current standardisation initiatives in the field of Open Source Hardware (OSH). While early initiatives focused on aspects such as licencing, intellectual property and documentation formats, recent efforts extend to ways for users to exercise their rights under open licences and to keep OSH projects discoverable and accessible online. We specifically introduce two standards that are currently being released and are seeking early users and contributors, the DIN SPEC 3105 and the Open Know-How Manifest Specification. Building on this, we reflect on challenges around standardisation in the OSH community and on relevant areas for future development such as an open tool chains, modularity and hardware-specific interface standards.

	abstract = {An MR-Linac can provide motion information of tumour and organs-at-risk before, during, and after beam delivery. However, MR imaging cannot provide real-time high-quality volumetric images which capture breath-to-breath variability of respiratory motion. Surrogate-driven motion models relate the motion of the internal anatomy to surrogate signals, thus can estimate the 3D internal motion from these signals. Internal surrogate signals based on patient anatomy can be extracted from 2D cine-MR images, which can be acquired on an MR-Linac during treatment, to build and drive motion models. In this paper we investigate different MRI-derived surrogate signals, including signals generated by applying principal component analysis to the image intensities, or control point displacements derived from deformable registration of the 2D cine-MR images. We assessed the suitability of the signals to build models that can estimate the motion of the internal anatomy, including sliding motion and breath-to-breath variability. We quantitatively evaluated the models by estimating the 2D motion in sagittal and coronal slices of 8 lung cancer patients, and comparing them to motion measurements obtained from image registration. For sagittal slices, using the first and second principal components on the control point displacements as surrogate signals resulted in the highest model accuracy, with a mean error over patients around 0.80 mm which was lower than the in-plane resolution. For coronal slices, all investigated signals except the skin signal produced mean errors over patients around 1 mm. These results demonstrate that surrogate signals derived from 2D cine-MR images, including those generated by applying principal component analysis to the image intensities or control point displacements, can accurately model the motion of the internal anatomy within a single sagittal or coronal slice. This implies the signals should also be suitable for modelling the 3D respiratory motion of the internal anatomy.},

Poisson’s ratio for the analyzed products was determined at the indicated temperature based on the measured acoustic parameters, sample density and the value of Young’s modulus calculated in mechanical tests. The average value of Poisson’s ratio was determined 0.49999, and it was similar to the values cited by other authors.

In these conditions, density of studied colloids was determined, and ultrasound signals transmitted through them were registered. Based on the ultrasonic measurement, the sound velocity was determined. Results of these measurements were used to derive several empirical models. These models allow, for example, to perform rapid calculations of potato starch colloid density at a given temperature based on the sound velocity measurement with a relative error of 0.15\% or even 0.09\% for specific frequency (10 MHz), which is the highest accuracy of considered methods.

When an ultrasonic transducer is used with acoustic loads its Impedance-Frequency-Phase (IFP) characteristics change. The changes produced in its frequency response are very large and require a readjustment in the control of the resonance frequency as well as the magnitude of the voltage. In this work, a study of the effects of the load type on the impedance-phase relation is made. Experimental tests to study the changes produced in the frequency response were performed in air, water and transformer oil. The different factors that should be taken into consideration in the numerical simulation for a good mechanical-acoustic design are analyzed. Characteristics such as geometry, acoustic impedance, resonance frequency and phase which the ultrasonic transducer and sonotrode must have for proper operation under an acoustic load are analyzed. A simple and economical method is used for the electrical characterization of the transducer. An analysis of the effect of the acoustic impedance between the different interfaces and as they affect the acoustic efficiency of the transducer is made.},

In order to overcome the problems mentioned above, a linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulse with a large time-bandwidth product can be used as the exciting signal in the ultrasonic inspection of the austenitic stainless steel welds, which can both enhance the average transmitted power and increase the SNR and time resolution by pulse compression process. Therefore, the ultrasonic time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) technique with the LFM excitation was carried out to realize an accurate sizing and locating detection in austenitic stainless steel welds. Compared with the conventional TOFD testing, the SNR can be increased 12–15 dB, and the measured accuracy is also enhanced obviously. Accordingly the measured depth error is less than 0.81 \% and the length error is less than 2.5 \%. The proposed method can both enhance the capabilities of the ultrasonic inspection of austenitic welds and the measurement accuracy of ultrasonic TOFD testing.},

This study proposed using ultrasound characterization of the mastoid to noninvasively measure MEE-induced mastoid effusion (ME) as a new strategy for determining the presence of MEE. In total, 53 patients were enrolled (Group I: normal, n = 20; Group II: proven MEE through both otoscopy and tympanometry, n = 15; Group III: patients with MEE having effusions observed during grommet surgery, n = 18). A 2.25-MHz delay-line transducer was used to measure backscattered signals from the mastoid. The Nakagami parameter was estimated using the acquired signals to model the echo amplitude distribution for quantifying changes in the acoustic structures of mastoid air cells. The median Nakagami parameter and interquartile range were 0.35 (0.34–0.37) for Group I, 0.39 (0.37–0.41) for Group II and 0.43 (0.39–0.51) for Group III. The echo amplitude distribution observed for patients with MEE was closer to Rayleigh distribution than that without MEE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis further revealed that the area under the ROC was 0.88, sensitivity was 72.73\%, specificity was 95\% and accuracy was 81.13\%. The proposed method has considerable potential for noninvasive and comfortable evaluation of MEE.},

In order to solve the problem that the large distribution range of pore size of porous materials leads to the large detection errors of porosity, the non-linear ultrasonic testing technique is applied. A graphite composite was used as the experimental object in the study. As the accuracy of porosity is directly related with feature extraction, the dynamic wavelet fingerprint (DWFP) technology was utilized to extract the feature parameter of the ultrasonic signals. The effects of the wavelet function, scale factor, and white slice ratio on the extraction of the nonlinear feature are discussed. The SEM photos were conducted using gray value to identify the aperture. The relationship between pore diameter and detection accuracy was studied. Its results show that the DWFP technology could identify the second harmonic component well, and the extracted nonlinear feature could be used for the quantitative trait of porosity. The larger the proportion of the small diameter holes and the smaller the aperture distribution range was, the smaller the error was. This preliminary research aimed to improve the nondestructive testing accuracy of porosity and it is beneficial to the application of porous material in the manufacturing field.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound Computed Tomography (USCT) of soft biological tissues today provides images with a high-level of resolution. The signal acquisition system using multichannel and/or multifrequency arrays performs in circular mode and the main (linear) inversion algorithms are based on compression wave propagation modeling. The main limits of these methods for bone imaging are due to the large impedance contrast between tissues, and to propagative phenomena generated through periosteal interfaces (mode conversion, attenuation). The linear inversion methods fail to provide high-level resolution images. Despite their performance and robustness, the non-linear methods are still today unsuitable for clinical applications because of the high computation time required. However, in the special case of children bone imaging, acquisition steps must be as fast as possible, with short-time exposure and low-intensity sonication. In this context, we have developed a fast-acquisition setup (1 sec.) based on a cylindrical-focusing ring antenna, and a protocol (\&lt; 5 sec.) using classical Born approximation and spatial Fourier transform. Unfortunately, the result today is a poor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) image. Previous work done to improve CNR used signal and image processing. This work focuses on this last point, and an automatic edge detection procedure, using Haar wavelet 2D-decompositon, combining k-means and Ostu algorithms. Results will be presented on ex vivo real bone samples and on geometrical mimicking bone phantom (SawbonesTM). An example of bone defect imaging will be presented and discussed.},

In this paper, a lightweight A-mode probe, consisting of housing and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, is proposed to enhance the detection of morphological changes of deep-layered muscles in the wearable HMI context. The PVDF-based probe, with 0.75-g weight and 0.6-mm thickness, is designed, simulated, fabricated, and validated in hand gesture recognition. Its classification accuracy achieves 97.64\%±1.83\%, which is practically accepted for the usage requirements of the existing wearable HMIs. This paper paves the way for feasible wearable HMIs in real-world applications with lightweight ultrasound probes.},

	abstract = {The long-term storage of nuclear-spent fuel in geological repositories has introduced the need to develop new technologies for safeguarding the fuel. Continuity of knowledge about the fuel's location must be maintained during transport of the copper canisters that contain the fuel from the encapsulation plant to the final repository. Among the possible different containment and surveillance measures are the identification and authentication of each canister. The authors propose an innovative solution for this purpose, which is based on the ultrasonic acquisition of two fingerprints: an artificial code realized by chamfers machined in the inner surface of the copper lid (identification) and a natural signature due to the weld between the lid and the tube (authentication). Several prototypes of ultrasonic acquisition devices have been developed and tested on real copper samples to validate the identification and authentication concepts. This article describes the design of a new, optimized version of the ultrasonic acquisition device. The aim of this new design is to provide a solution for the identification and authentication of copper canisters using a portable device that is cost-effective and easy to use, which does not require the presence of an inspector in the field. The mechanical design of the reader has been upgraded with the introduction of a stepper motor and a new probe holder that includes a beam splitter to acquire two fingerprints simultaneously. The new device has been tested on copper samples, both with and without chamfers, and the results are reported in this article. The implementation of the seal fingerprint acquisition device (SFAD) within the new portable acquisition system is discussed at the end of this article with the goal of improving the electronic performance of the acquisition device in the field.},

	abstract = {Distributed digital manufacturing of free and open-source scientific hardware (FOSH) used for scientific experiments has been shown to in general reduce the costs of scientific hardware by 90–99\%. In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under \$20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible.},

This work investigates the feasibility of embedding extreme learning machines in microcontrollers, in order to execute in situ training for an ultrasound nondestructive evaluation. Principal component analysis and autoencoders were evaluated as dimensionality reduction methods in a data set acquired from welded SAE 1020 carbon steel plates containing four types of defects. A binary-encoded random weight approach is proposed, whose results were tested over four different probability density functions used to generate the random weights. The obtained experimental results matched the accuracy of a previous work, run in computer environment for higher dimensionality data. In this work a dimensionality reduction of 75\% and elapsed time for system training of less than 0.5 ms in microcontroller were achieved, indicating the suitability of such embedded networks for the studied case.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13683},
	abstract = {The emergence of capsule endoscopy has provided a means of capturing video of the small intestines without having to resort to an invasive procedure involving intubation. However, real-time video streaming to a receiver outside the body remains challenging for capsule endoscopy. Traditional electromagnetic-based solutions are limited in their data rates and available power. Recently, ultrasound was investigated as a communication channel for through-tissue data transmission. To achieve real-time video streaming through tissue, data rates of ultrasound need to exceed 1 Mbps. In a previous study, we demonstrated ultrasound communications with data rates greater than 30 Mbps with two focused ultrasound transducers using a large footprint laboratory system through slabs of lossy tissues [1]. While the form factor of the transmitter is also crucial for capsule endoscopy, it is obvious that a large, focused transducer cannot fit within the size of a capsule. Several other challenges for achieving high-speed ultrasonic communication through tissue include strong reflections leading to multipath effects and attenuation. In this work, we demonstrate ultrasonic video communications using a mm-scale microcrystal transmitter with video streaming supplied by a camera connected to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The signals were transmitted through a tissue-mimicking phantom and through the abdomen of a rabbit in vivo. The ultrasound signal was recorded by an array probe connected to a Verasonics Vantage system and decoded back to video. To improve the received signal quality, we combined the signal from multiple channels of the array probe. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation was used to reduce the receiver complexity under a strong multipath environment.},

Proceeding with the design of electric impedance matching circuit for piezoelectric sensors, actuators, and transducers require careful consideration of the frequencies of operation, transmitter or receiver impedance, power supply or driver impedance and the impedance of the receiver electronics. This paper reviews the techniques available for matching the electric impedance of piezoelectric sensors, actuators, and transducers with their accessories like amplifiers, cables, power supply, receiver electronics and power storage. The techniques related to the design of power supply, preamplifier, cable, matching circuits for electric impedance matching with sensors, actuators, and transducers have been presented. The paper begins with the common tools, models, and material properties used for the design of electric impedance matching. Common analytical and numerical methods used to develop electric impedance matching networks have been reviewed. The role and importance of electrical impedance matching on the overall performance of the transducer system have been emphasized throughout. The paper reviews the common methods and new methods reported for electrical impedance matching for specific applications. The paper concludes with special applications and future perspectives considering the recent advancements in materials and electronics.},

	abstract = {Acquisition times and storage requirements have become increasingly important in signal-processing applications, as the sizes of datasets have increased. Hence, compressed sensing (CS) has emerged as an alternative processing technique, as original signals can be reconstructed using fewer data samples collected at frequencies below the Nyquist sampling rate. However, further analysis of CS data in both time and frequency domains requires the reconstruction of the original form of the time-domain data, as traditional signal-processing techniques are designed for uncompressed data. In this paper, we propose a signal-processing framework that extracts spectral properties for frequency-domain analysis directly from under-sampled ultrasound CS data, using an appropriate basis matrix, and efficiently converts this into the envelope of a time-domain signal, avoiding full reconstruction. The technique generates more accurate results than the traditional framework in both time- and frequency-domain analyses, and is simpler and faster in execution than full reconstruction, without any loss of information. Hence, the proposed framework offers a new standard for signal processing using ultrasound CS data, especially for small and portable systems handling large datasets.},

	abstract = {Investigation of the high-pressure thermophysical properties of biofuels, e.g., bulk modulus, surface tension, and viscosity is of paramount importance in fuel injection systems in diesel engines. Another crucial and dangerous phenomenon that may occur in biofuels at high pressures is phase transition (solidification), which can drastically increase the viscosity of the biofuel. This effect may hamper proper operation of the engine, especially under cold-start conditions. Unfortunately, the availability of high-pressure thermophysical properties of biofuels is still limited. The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of high pressures on thermophysical properties of biofuels on the example of rapeseed fatty acid methyl esters (RME) in a wide range of pressures (0.1to250MPa) and temperatures (5to20°C). To this end we employed innovative ultrasonic techniques, i.e., the Bleustein-Gulyaev surface acoustic waves for measuring RME viscosity, and ultrasonic bulk compressional waves for measuring sound velocity in RME and consequently evaluating RME thermophysical parameters, e.g., bulk modulus and surface tension. The viscosity of the measured RME displayed an abrupt increase at pressures: 260 MPa (t=20°C), 230 MPa (t=15°C), 190 MPa (t=10°C), and 130 MPa (t=5°C). Evidently it was a signature of the phase transition (solidification) occurring in the RME. The discovered high viscosity high-pressure phase in RME can be very detrimental for operation of modern common rail Diesel engines. Therefore, the results of research presented in this paper should be interesting for engineers and designers working with modern common rail Diesel engines using biofuels.},

The microstructural observations of five different plasterboard types were performed through optical and scanning electron microscopy. The deterioration of their properties was evaluated by using a three-point bending test and a subsequent ultrasonic (ultrasound testing (UT)) longitudinal wave velocity measurement. Depending on the material porosity, a loss of UT wave velocity from 6\% to 35\% and a considerable decrease in material strength from 70\% to 80\% were observed. Four types of approximated formulae were proposed to describe the dependence of UT wave velocity on board moisture content.

	abstract = {Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging modality worldwide. It is abundant, extremely safe, portable, and inexpensive. In this review, we consider some of the current development trends for ultrasound imaging, which build upon its current strength and the popularity it experiences among medical imaging professional users.Ultrasound has rapidly expanded beyond traditional radiology departments and cardiology practices. Computing power and data processing capabilities of commonly available electronics put ultrasound systems in a lab coat pocket or on a user's mobile phone. Taking advantage of new contributions and discoveries in ultrasound physics, signal processing algorithms, and electronics, the performance of ultrasound systems and transducers have progressed in terms of them becoming smaller, with higher imaging performance, and having lower cost. Ultrasound operates in real time, now at ultrafast speeds; kilohertz frame rates are already achieved by many systems.Ultrasound has progressed beyond anatomical imaging and monitoring blood flow in large vessels. With clinical approval of ultrasound contrast agents (gas-filled microbubbles) that are administered in the bloodstream, tissue perfusion studies are now routine. Through the use of modern ultrasound pulse sequences, individual microbubbles, with subpicogram mass, can be detected and observed in real time, many centimeters deep in the body. Ultrasound imaging has broken the wavelength barrier; by tracking positions of microbubbles within the vasculature, superresolution imaging has been made possible. Ultrasound can now trace the smallest vessels and capillaries, and obtain blood velocity data in those vessels.Molecular ultrasound imaging has now moved closer to clinic; the use of microbubbles with a specific affinity to endothelial biomarkers allows selective accumulation and retention of ultrasound contrast in the areas of ischemic injury, inflammation, or neoangiogenesis. This will aid in noninvasive molecular imaging and may provide additional help with real-time guidance of biopsy, surgery, and ablation procedures.The ultrasound field can be tightly focused inside the body, many centimeters deep, with millimeter precision, and ablate lesions by energy deposition, with thermal or mechanical bioeffects. Some of such treatments are already in clinical use, with more indications progressing through the clinical trial stage. In conjunction with intravascular microbubbles, focused ultrasound can be used for tissue-specific drug delivery; localized triggered release of sequestered drugs from particles in the bloodstream may take time to get to clinic. A combination of intravascular microbubbles with circulating drug and low-power ultrasound allows transient opening of vascular endothelial barriers, including blood-brain barrier; this approach has reached clinical trial stage. Therefore, the drugs that normally would not be getting to the target tissue in the brain will now have an opportunity to produce therapeutic efficacy.Overall, medical ultrasound is developing at a brisk rate, even in an environment where other imaging modalities are also advancing rapidly and may be considered more lucrative. With all the current advances that we discuss, and many more to come, ultrasound may help solve many problems that modern medicine is facing.},

Forty non-dysphagic adults of both genders who were naïve to the Mendelsohn maneuver participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to receive ultrasound or surface electromyography (sEMG) as biofeedback when acquiring the Mendelsohn maneuver. Thirty-eight subjects (n = 19) completed the Learning phase. Accuracy of executing the Mendelsohn maneuver was measured immediately (Post-training percentage accuracy) and one week post-training (Retention percentage accuracy). Whereas comparable numbers of training blocks were completed by the two groups (t(31.51) = 3.68, p = 0.330), the Ultrasound group attained significantly higher percentage accuracies than the sEMG group at both Post-training (t(28.88) = 4.04, p {\textless} 0.001, d = 1.309) and Retention (t(30.78) = 2.13, p = 0.042, d = 0.690). Ultrasound is a more effective biofeedback than sEMG in the acquisition of the Mendelsohn maneuver and may be adopted to the rehabilitative treatment for dysphagic individuals. Non-specificity of sEMG as biofeedback should be emphasized when it is employed in the training and learning of swallowing maneuvers. Findings from the present study suggest that ultrasound is preferable to sEMG as biofeedback in the learning of the Mendelsohn maneuver.},

	abstract = {High frequency ultrasonic imaging provides clinicians with high-resolution diagnostic images and more accurate measurement results. The technique is now widely used in ophthalmology, dermatology, and small animal imaging. However, since ultrasonic attenuation in tissue increases rapidly with increasing frequency, the depth of detection of high frequency ultrasound in tissue is limited to a few millimeters. In this paper, a novel method of using Golay-coded excitation as a replacement for conventional single-pulse excitation in high frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy was proposed, and real-time imaging was realized. While maintaining the transmission voltage and image resolution unchanged, the detection depth can be effectively improved. The ultrasonic transmission frequency is 30 MHz and the transmission voltage is ± 60 V p-p. In this study, 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit coding sequences and decoding compression were used. To verify the effectiveness of the coding sequence in real-time imaging of ultrasound biomicroscopy, we designed a 10-μm diameter line target echo experiment, an ultrasound phantom experiment, and an in vitro porcine eye experiment. The experimental results show that the code/decode method of signal processing can not only maintain a resolution consistent with that of single-pulse transmission, but can also improve the detection depth and signal-to-noise ratio.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in ultrasound technology have made ultrasound equipment more versatile, portable, and accessible than ever. Modern handheld, ultra-portable ultrasound devices have been developed by multiple companies and are contributing to make bedside ultrasound evaluation a practice available to all physicians. The significance of making point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) a common practice that all physicians eventually can use in the evaluation of their patients is changing the way medicine is practiced, allowing physicians to quickly obtain valuable information to complement the traditional physical examination. Despite the proven benefits of using bedside ultrasound imaging as a part of the patient evaluation and for procedure guidance, adoption of this technology still is not widespread among anesthesiology clinicians nor is there uniform teaching of ultrasound skills to anesthesia residents and faculty. Among obstacles that have been identified as precluding achievement of the goal of widespread utilization of POCUS among anesthesia professionals and trainees, are the availability of equipment for all physicians when it is needed and lack of instructor supervision for trainees who desire to use ultrasound but do not always have an instructor knowledgeable in POCUS with them when an ultrasound examination is warranted. Herein, the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of available ultra-portable, handheld ultrasound devices are analyzed, with a focus on the Butterfly iQ (Butterfly Network, Inc, Guilford, CT) pocket probe, which is available at the authors’ institution, and how some of its features, such as the capacity to emulate multiple transducers and its cloud-sharing and teleguidance technology, may contribute to increase the availability and use of POCUS by anesthesia clinicians.},

Traditionally, UAV remote inspections rely on high-resolution cameras, providing a visual overview of surface condition. This photogrammetric inspection, however, cannot distinguish minute discontinuities or deformations beneath a surface coating. Ultrasonic inspection is a Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) method conventionally used in corrosion mapping. Surface contacting ultrasonic transducers offer the potential for internal inspection of an industrial asset, providing enhanced structural integrity information. However, manually piloting a UAV with sufficient surface proximity to perform a detailed, contact-based examination requires a highly developed skillset and intense concentration. Limitations of payload mass and electronic interference also represent significant challenges to be overcome. Addressing such issues, this paper demonstrates the implementation of an autonomous UAV system with an integrated ultrasonic contact measurement payload.

Ultrasonic inspection is primarily a contact-based NDT method, that grants the opportunity to remotely monitor the structural health of an industrial asset with enhanced internal integrity information. Presented in this paper is an implementation of an autonomous UAV system, equipped with an ultrasonic thickness measurement payload. This system is designed to conduct ultrasonic inspections of non-magnetic facilities and industrial infrastructure where surface adhesion cannot be achieved magnetically. Operating within a laboratory environment, this system autonomously positioned the transducer on a vertically mounted, unpainted, aluminium sample and completed an ultrasonic thickness measurement without manual intervention. An onboard laser scanner provided instantaneous UAV alignment and standoff error measurements versus the sample’s surface normal vector. While inspecting a region of the aluminium sample with 12.92 mm nominal thickness, the UAV system demonstrated a measurement error of 0.03 mm. During this process, the standard deviation of the craft’s positional error was recorded to be below 63.26 mm, accompanied by an angular alignment error versus the surface normal vector of below 2.71°. The accuracy of the UAV deployed inspection, including thickness measurement accuracy and positional accuracy, depends on many factors. As such, transducer alignment constraints, electrical noise and UAV stability are investigated and discussed. Findings from this paper may be taken to inform future research regarding autonomous airborne ultrasonic inspection of constructed infrastructure and industrial facilities.},

By exploiting the long idle time of the US system, an analog switch can be used to acquire data of both systems using a single output channel simultaneously. On the nuclear medicine (NM) gamma probe side, energy resolutions of 18.4\% and 17.5\% were acquired with the standalone system and with the proposed switching circuit, respectively, when irradiated with a Co-57 radiation source. Similarly, signal-to-noise ratios of 14.89 and 13.12 dB were achieved when US echo signals were acquired with the standalone system and with the proposed switching circuit, respectively. Lastly, a combined US-gamma probe was used to scan a glass target and a sealed radiation source placed in a water tank. The results confirmed that, by using a hybrid US-gamma probe system, it is possible to distinguish between the two objects and acquire structural information (ultrasound) alongside molecular information (gamma radiation source).},

	abstract = {Ultrasound methods are currently employed in a wide range of applications. They are integrated in complex electronics systems, like clinical echographs, but also in small and compact boards, like industrial sensors, embedded systems, and portable devices. Ultrasound waves are typically generated by energizing a piezoelectric transducer through a high-voltage sequence of small sinusoidal bursts. Moreover, in several applications, the ultrasound board should work in a wide frequency range. This makes the transmitter, i.e., the electronics that drives the transducer, a key part of the circuit. The use of a small transformer simplifies the electronics and reduces the need of high-voltage power sources. Unfortunately, the transformer magnetic core, when subjected to the sequence of bursts employed in ultrasound, is particularly prone to saturation. This phenomenon limits the maximum voltage and/or the minimum frequency the transformer can be employed for. In this work, a transmitter based on a transformer is proposed. Inspired by the technique currently employed in the power network transformers, we added a prefluxing circuit, which improves the saturation performance 2-fold. The proposed transmitter was implemented in a test board and experimented with two commercial transformers at 80 Vpp. Measurements show that the proposed prefluxing circuit moves down the minimum usable frequency 2-fold: from 400 to 200 kHz for one of the two transformers, and from 2.4 to 1.2 MHz for the other.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, ultrasound imaging (US) has made extensive applications in the field of the medical imaging due to its particular advantages, in which the transducer plays an important role. The traditional single-frequency transducers can not meet the requirements of various medical applications, such as harmonic imaging (HI), second-order ultrasound field imaging (SURF) and acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI). Therefore, multi-frequency, especially dual-frequency (DF) transducers are proposed, each of which transmits and/or receives the ultrasound in different frequencies. The multi-frequency transducer configurations mainly contain five types which named vertical stack, horizontal stack, transducers with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) layer, interleaved arrays and annular array. In this paper, the design, fabrication and recent developments of the multi-frequency transducers are presented and compared by defragmenting more than a hundred papers.},

This paper presents a wearable multichannel A-mode ultrasound system for the multiperspective muscle contraction detection against its existing bulky ultrasound sensing counterpart. The system consists of a waveform generator and a waveform amplifier for ultrasound excitation, as well as a signal processing module for echo receiving, amplifying, and transmitting. In addition, a miniaturized transducer was optimized for muscle contraction monitoring using 1-3 piezoelectric composite. The system's superiorities on excitation pulse, detection depth, and axial resolution were validated by the evaluation experiments. And in vivo muscle deformation detection and virtual prosthesis control experiments (target achievement control test) demonstrated its ability in rehabilitation applications, with a task completion rate of 100\% and path efficiency of 93.30\%. These results confirmed the reliability of the proposed ultrasound system and paved the way for its applications in rehabilitation treatment and prosthesis research.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict wrist and hand motions simultaneously is essential for natural controls of hand protheses. In this paper, we propose a novel method that includes subclass discriminant analysis (SDA) and principal component analysis for the simultaneous prediction of wrist rotation (pronation/supination) and finger gestures using wearable ultrasound. We tested the method on eight finger gestures with concurrent wrist rotations. Results showed that SDA was able to achieve accurate classification of both finger gestures and wrist rotations under dynamic wrist rotations. When grouping the wrist rotations into three subclasses, about 99.2 ± 1.2\% of finger gestures and 92.8 ± 1.4\% of wrist rotations can be accurately classified. Moreover, we found that the first principal component (PC1) of the selected ultrasound features was linear to the wrist rotation angle regardless of finger gestures. We further used PC1 in an online tracking task for continuous wrist control and demonstrated that a wrist tracking precision (R2) of 0.954 ± 0.012 and a finger gesture classification accuracy of 96.5 ± 1.7\% can be simultaneously achieved, with only two minutes of user training. Our proposed simultaneous wrist/hand control scheme is training-efficient and robust, paving the way for musculature-driven-artificial hand control and rehabilitation treatment.},

Furthermore, this study aims to make the design and implementation of signal processing algorithms in embedded software and reconfigurable hardware very efficient. To demonstrate the computational efficiency and design flexibility of the RUSH platform, several important computationally intense algorithms such as split spectrum processing, chirplet signal decomposition and coherent averaging have been successfully ported to the RUSH platform, emphasising the many parts of the RUSH architecture.},

Traditionally Surface Electromyography based Approaches (SEMG) have been used to satisfy the purpose of providing Bio-Signal control in upper extremity Prosthesis. Although these methods have been shown to be robust, there still exists issues in performance within clinical environments. In recent years, Ultrasound signal based methods have seen growing interest within the field of motion Recognition, largely due to the increased resolution, deeper muscle observation, and reduced cross-talk that can be achieved in comparison to SEMG methods. However, the methods to be applied for hand Motion recognition are still only just beginning to be explored. In this paper, we shall investigate the applicability of SEMG feature extraction techniques to Ultrasound based hand motion recognition and the subsequent impact of Sensor shift on these features. The results of this study indicate that SEMG feature extraction techniques have excellent single location accuracy in Ultrasound based Hand motion recognition. However this paper more visibly presents the strong impact of Sensor Shift on A-Mode ultrasound based hand motion Recognition, and finally presents which feature extraction methods are most robust to this shift.},

	doi = {10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2661383},
	abstract = {Pulse compression has been used for decades in radar, sonar, medical, and industrial ultrasound. It consists in transmitting a modulated or coded excitation, which is then cross-correlated with the received signal such that received echoes are time compressed, thereby increasing their intensity and hence the system resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A central problem in pulse-echo systems is that while longer coded excitations yield higher SNRs, the length of the coded excitation or sequence is limited by the distance between the closest reflector and the transmitter/receiver. In this paper, a new approach to coded excitation is presented whereby receive intervals or pauses are introduced within the excitation itself; reception takes place in these intervals. As a result, the code length is no longer limited by the distance to the closest reflector and a higher SNR increase can be realized. Moreover, the excitation can be coded in such a way that continuous transmission becomes possible, which reduces the overall duration of the system response to changes in the medium. The optimal distribution of the receive intervals within the excitation is discussed, and an example of its application in industrial ultrasound is presented. The example consists of an electromagnetic-acoustic transducer driven with 4.5 V, where a clear signal can be obtained in quasi-real-time (e.g., {\textasciitilde}9-Hz refresh rate), while commercially available systems require 1200 V for a similar performance.},

A new scanner has been developed that incorporates electronic position control of the transducer; thus permitting electronic programming of scan linearity and sector width. The system employs a reversible low-inertia servo motor that moves the transducer by means of a three-to-one gear reduction. The use of the gear reduction enables the transducer rotational inertia to be counterbalanced by that of the motor, thus reducing the mechanical vibration of the system. Sine and cosine voltages necessary for display purposes are generated photoelectrically from a rotating disc mounted on the rear of the motor shaft. Curved slits in the disc are machined to permit light intensity proportional to the sine and cosine of the sector position to reach the detector. The gear reduction to the transducer was accounted for in the calculations of the slit geometry. A coil spring attached to the motor shaft was selected for a system mechanical resonance of approximately 10 Hz in order to reduce the electrical power consumed by the system. The sine voltage from the scanner is employed as a position signal for the feedback control. With this system, the sector size may be adjusted from 0 to \&plusmn; 25 degrees.},

For reasons of data security and transmitting distances, this communication should be realized using ultrasound, which is generated and detected by capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs). These offer the advantage of an inherent high bandwidth and a high integration capability. To protect the surrounding tissue, it has to be encapsulated. In contrast to previous results of other research groups dealing with the encapsulation of CMUTs, the goal here is to integrate the CMUT into the housing of a medical implant. In this work, CMUTs were designed and fabricated for a center frequency of 2 MHz in water and experimentally tested on their characteristics for operation behind layers of Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and titanium, two typical materials for the housings of medical implants. It could be shown that with silicone as a coupling layer it is possible to operate a CMUT behind the housing of an implant. Although it changes the characteristics of the CMUT, the setup is found to be well suited for communication between two transducers over a distance of at least 8 cm.},

In this case, sixteen trial objects were selected, which gives 48th optimization parameters (three parameters for each trial object). During the optimization process some of them could diminish to zero; the others would change the position and dimensions in such a way that the calculated signal become as close as possible to the measured one. The objective function and linear inequality constrain were defined. The optimization process is very sensitive how far away from the optimal solution the starting point was defined.

	abstract = {This work presents an ultrasound tomography imaging system and method for quantitative mapping of the sound speed in liquid masses. It is highly desirable to be able to inspect vessel fluid mass distribution, notably in the chemical and food industrial operations. Optimization of industrial reactors has been crucial to the improvement of industrial processes. There is a great need to investigate how and if tomographic imaging sensors could aid the automatic control of these process tanks. Single-measurement ultrasound techniques and especially spectrometric methods have been a subject of study of industrial applications. Tomographic systems provide key multi-dimensional and spatial information when compared to the well-established single-channel measurement system. Recently, ultrasound tomography has attracted a great deal of interest in a wide spectrum of industrial applications. The system has been designed as 32 piezoelectric ring-array positioned in a 30 cm tank, with an excitation frequency of 40 kHz. Two-dimensional transmission travel-time tomography was developed to reconstruct the fluid mass distributions. Prior experiments are mainly based on inclusions of a few centimetres and on a liquid solution of different concentrations. They have been conducted to test the spatial and quantitative resolution of the ultrasound imaging device. Analysing the reconstructed images, it is possible to provide accurate spatial resolution with low position errors. The system also demonstrated inclusion movement with a temporal resolution of 4 frames per second (fps) in dynamical imaging sense. Sound velocity quantitative imaging was developed for the investigation of ultrasonic propagation in different liquids. This work, for the first time, shows how quantitative sound velocity imaging using transmission mode time of flight data could be used to characterize liquid density distribution of industrial reactors. The results suggest that ultrasound tomography can be used to quantitatively monitor important process parameters.},

Luminal dimensions were assessed with and without echogenic contrast dye (Laevovist®, Schering AG, Germany). After application of contrast dye, correlation of luminal area between histology and ultrasound was improved from r = 0.62 to r = 0.77 (device B; p {\textless} 0.05) and from r = 0.82 to r = 0.88 (device A; p = NS). Low accuracy of lumen measurements in segments {\textless}2.5 mm could be improved by application of contrast dye. The number of quadrants in which wall thickness measurements were impossible was significantly higher for device B (n = 56; 22\%) than for device A (n = 28; 11\%); p {\textless} 0.01. This may be due to the different ringdown diameters of both systems (B, 2.6 mm; A, 2.0 mm; p {\textless} 0.0001). In assessing wall thickness only in segments of {\textgreater}2.5 mm, a reliable correlation between ultrasound and histology was found (A, r = 0.80; B, r = 0.60). Sensitivity of plaque (n = 51) detection was lower for device B (63\%) than for device A (82\%, p {\textless} 0.05), and measurements correlated with histology only for device A. There are considerable differences in the accuracy of ultrasound measurements between mechanical systems. Nevertheless, additional application of contrast dye can improve accuracy of luminal measurements, especially in smaller vessels.},

The effect is produced by combining the flow imaging capability of a multigate pulse-Doppler flow detector with a fast rotational pulse-echo B-mode scanner. The duplex system was designed for performing ultrasonic echo-Doppler arteriography where the location and geometry of the interface between occlusive atherosclerotic tissue and blood is of prime concern. Initial results on normal arteries in vivo are illustrated. Spatial alignment of echo and Doppler images is obtained by using the same transducer and scanning mechanism for both. However, clinical trials on patients with verified occlusive arterial disease indicated a two-transducer system would be more desirable. It is concluded that superposition of images of both tissue and blood decreases the uncertainties inherent in the display of either image alone.},

The unique feature is the transducer head which contains a single moving part — the transducer — enclosed within a light-weight, hand held, and vibration free case. The frame rate, sector width, stop action angle, are all operator programmable. The frame rate can be varied from 12 to 30 frames s−1 and the sector width from 0° to 60°. Conversion from sector to time motion (T/M) modes are instant and two options are available, a freeze position high density T/M and a low density T/M obtainable simultaneously during sector visualization. Unusual electronic features are: automatic gain control, electronic recording of images on video tape in rf format, and ability to post-process images during video playback to extract T/M display and to change time gain control (tgc) and image size.},

A resolution volume of approximately 1.5 by 3 by 4 millimeters is achieved optimally with commercially available systems operating at 2.25 megahertz. The various instrument designs are described in the context of clinical usage.

	abstract = {An ultrasound instrument has been developed that combines a real-time cross-sectional imaging system and a spectrum analyzer-based Doppler velocimeter. This combination allows the Doppler sample volume to be superimposed on the cross-sectional image of the heart so that the sample volume can be located accurately. The same 2.2 MHz transducer utilized for cross-sectional imaging is stopped mechanically and quickly switched to transmit and receive the Doppler ultrasound signal. Preliminary experience in 20 young and adult normal subjects indicates that it is possible to place the Doppler sample volume in the proximal main pulmonary artery at a point where the sound beam and blood flow stream are parallel. Measurement of the distance from transducer to the sample volume and the peak blood flow velocities in the main pulmonary artery of normal subjects indicates that these quantities are within the measurement capabilities of the system. The ultimate goal of this device is to make measurements of volume blood flow in man noninvasively.},

	abstract = {Resolution is the ability of the echocardiographic system to distinguish closely lying structures. This is usually defined in two directions: laterally (lateral resolution) and in depth (axial resolution). With use of short ultrasonic pulses, axial resolution is not a major problem. By far the more important problem is the limited lateral resolution that results from the finite beam width of current ultrasonic devices. This results in the display of echoes that originate from off-axis structures. How these off-axis or “spurious echoes” affect the display is a function of the way the echographic information is handled. In conventional M-mode tracings, spurious echoes are displayed at a site where there is no directly corresponding anatomic structure, whereas with two-dimensional imaging, these echoes may result in important distortions of structures. The underlying principles are illustrated by a clinical experiment wherein the ball of a Starr-Edwards mitral valve prosthesis serves as a target of known shape and dimensions. These data are used to elucidate some of the problems and potential errors encountered in the interpretation of clinical M-mode recordings of the aorta, mitral valve and the left ventricular endocardium as well as their cross-sectional analysis. They also explain the present limitations of quantification of left ventricular performance from crosssectional images.},

The scanner uses a single small transducer with a flexible shaft to permit easy swallowing by adults and mechanically scans ultrasonic beams within the esophagus. The small transducer in the esophagus is rotated through a full 360 ° at a rate of 15 to 50 cycles/s, and cardiac images obtained through the esophageal wall are displayed on a cathode ray tube in real time. The transesophageal scanning technique was evaluated in more than 50 adult patients. Aside from some slight gagging, no serious complications were encountered. In all patients, high quality images of most portions of the heart were obtained. There was little difference in the image quality among various patients.},

This new framework of SR scan conversion reconstructs an improved HR frame by using the scan data of several low resolution (LR) frames. It also unifies the speckle reduction and HR scan conversion in such a way that it has become a single operation to generate a super-resolved image with lesser loss of information. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model on synthetic images, ultrasound simulated (by Field II software) images and real ultrasound image dataset and the comparison is performed against some of the publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound image enhancement techniques. Significant improvement in image quality has been achieved due to utilization of non-redundant information present in the scan data of the LR frames. We demonstrate the improvement of the proposed technique through the computation of perceptual and quantitative quality metrics, such as, SSIM, PSNR etc. over the recent competing methods.},

	abstract = {Speech sound disorders are a common communication impairment in childhood. Because speech disorders can negatively affect the lives and the development of children, clinical intervention is often recommended. To help with diagnosis and treatment, clinicians use instrumented methods such as spectrograms or ultrasound tongue imaging to analyse speech articulations. Analysis with these methods can be laborious for clinicians, therefore there is growing interest in its automation. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of ultrasound tongue imaging for the automatic detection of speech articulation errors. Our systems are trained on typically developing child speech and augmented with a database of adult speech using audio and ultrasound. Evaluation on typically developing speech indicates that pre-training on adult speech and jointly using ultrasound and audio gives the best results with an accuracy of 86.9\%. To evaluate on disordered speech, we collect pronunciation scores from experienced speech and language therapists, focusing on cases of velar fronting and gliding of /r/. The scores show good inter-annotator agreement for velar fronting, but not for gliding errors. For automatic velar fronting error detection, the best results are obtained when jointly using ultrasound and audio. The best system correctly detects 86.6\% of the errors identified by experienced clinicians. Out of all the segments identified as errors by the best system, 73.2\% match errors identified by clinicians. Results on automatic gliding detection are harder to interpret due to poor inter-annotator agreement, but appear promising. Overall findings suggest that automatic detection of speech articulation errors has potential to be integrated into ultrasound intervention software for automatically quantifying progress during speech therapy.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound images are widespread in medical diagnosis for muscle-skeletal, cardiac, and obstetrical diseases, due to the efficiency and non-invasiveness of the acquisition methodology. However, ultrasound acquisition introduces a speckle noise in the signal, that corrupts the resulting image and affects further processing operations, and the visual analysis that medical experts conduct to estimate patient diseases. Our main goal is to define a universal deep learning framework for real-time denoising of ultrasound images. We analyse and compare state-of-the-art methods for the smoothing of ultrasound images (e.g., spectral, low-rank, and deep learning denoising algorithms), in order to select the best one in terms of accuracy, preservation of anatomical features, and computational cost. Then, we propose a tuned version of the selected state-of-the-art denoising methods (e.g., WNNM), to improve the quality of the denoised images, and extend its applicability to ultrasound images. To handle large data sets of ultrasound images with respect to applications and industrial requirements, we introduce a denoising framework that exploits deep learning and HPC tools, and allows us to replicate the results of state-of-the-art denoising methods in a real-time execution.},

	abstract = {Compared with B-mode imaging, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging is more helpful in research and clinical application. At present, the 3D ultrasound images can be acquired directly with two-dimensional (2D) array transducer or reconstructed from a series of B-mode images obtained with one-dimensional (1D) array transducer. Imaging with 2D array transducer can achieve a high frame rate, but suffering from the complexity of the imaging system, such as the large amount of channels, and high computational complexity. Reconstructing 3D images from a series of B-mode images can be implemented by recording the position and orientation of the slice images. This is a low-cost and flexible imaging method, but usually suffering from the low imaging quality and low frame rate. In our previous work, a novel 3D ultrasound imaging method in frequency domain with a moved 1D array transducer is presented. This method can reduce the computational complexity with FFT, and get improved imaging quality and frame rate to some extent. Besides, this method can be adopted to construct images with a row–column-addressed 2D array, which can reduce the amount of channels effectively. In this paper, a two-steps implementation of this imaging method is proposed, in which the combined implementation of the 3D imaging is decomposed to two steps of 2D imaging processes in Frequency domain. In the first step, the received echoes of the 1D array transducer at each position are processed with a 2D imaging processes in the lateral- axial planes. In the second step, a 2D imaging processes is preformed in the planes of orthogonal to the transducer. Simulation results show that the two-steps implementation can achieve almost the same imaging quality to the previous work. Compared with the implementation of 3D imaging in our previous work, the proposed two-steps implementation can be carried out with parallel process to improve the computational efficiency, or carried out with loop to reduce the hardware cost. Besides, the first step can be performed with a conventional DAS imaging method when a cylindrical wave is adopted for imaging. The influence of the spread angle of the field is also discussed.},

However, current practices typically require time consuming post-processing to track muscle length changes from B-mode images. A real-time measurement tool would not only save processing time but would also help pave the way toward closed-loop applications based on feedback signals driven by \textit{in vivo} muscle length change patterns. In this paper, we benchmark an approach that combines traditional machine learning (ML) models with B-mode ultrasound recordings to obtain muscle fascicle length changes in real-time. To gauge the utility of this framework for ‘in-the-loop’ applications, we evaluate accuracy of the extracted muscle length change signals against time-series’ derived from a standard, post-hoc automated tracking algorithm.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We collected B-mode ultrasound data from the soleus muscle of six participants performing five defined ankle motion tasks: (a) seated, constrained ankle plantarflexion, (b) seated, free ankle dorsi/plantarflexion, (c) weight-bearing, calf raises (d) walking, and then a (e) mix. We trained machine learning (ML) models by pairing muscle fascicle lengths obtained from standardized automated tracking software (UltraTrack) with the respective B-mode ultrasound image input to the tracker, frame-by-frame. Then we conducted hyperparameter optimizations for five different ML models using a grid search to find the best performing parameters for a combination of high correlation and low RMSE between ML and UltraTrack processed muscle fascicle length trajectories. Finally, using the global best model/hyperparameter settings, we comprehensively evaluated training-testing outcomes within subject (\textit{i.e}., train and test on same subject), cross subject (\textit{i.e}., train on one subject, test on another) and within/direct cross task (\textit{i.e}., train and test on same subject, but different task).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Support vector machine (SVM) was the best performing model with an average \textit{r =} 0.70 ±0.34 and average RMSE = 2.86 ±2.55 mm across all direct training conditions and average \textit{r =} 0.65 ±0.35 and average RMSE = 3.28 ±2.64 mm when optimized for all cross-participant conditions. Comparisons between ML vs. UltraTrack (\textit{i.e}., ground truth) tracked muscle fascicle length versus time data indicated that ML tracked images reliably capture the salient qualitative features in ground truth length change data, even when correlation values are on the lower end.

	abstract = {One of the main advantages of ultrasonic arrays over conventional single-element transducers is the possibility to electronically steer and focus the ultrasonic beam. Accurate beam manipulation depends on knowledge of the directivity function of the transducer elements. Usually, the directivity function is obtained through a complicated test based on measurements of the acoustic pressure field by a hydrophone over a plane or volume surrounding the transducer. In this paper, we propose a simpler method to determine the directivity function of linear arrays. Echo signals are acquired in a setup consisting of only a small reflector and a phased array transducer in an underwater assembly. Then, A-scan signals are processed to obtain the parameters that yield the experimental directivity function. We present results showing that images reconstructed with the Corrected Total Focusing Method (which accounts for both spatial amplitude dependency and directivity) can be improved if the experimental directivity function is used rather than the theoretical curve. Specifically, artifacts are reduced and the amplitudes of identical reflectors in different positions are more uniform throughout the reconstructed image.},

	abstract = {Complementary Golay coded sequences (CGCS) have several advantages over conventional short pulse transmitted signals. Specifically, CGCS allow the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to be increased. Moreover, due to matched filtering and compression, echoes resembling the short pulse waveform with substantially higher amplitude can be obtained. However, CGCS require two subsequent transmissions to obtain a single compressed signal. This decreases the data acquisition rate and the frame rate of ultrasound imaging by two-fold. To alleviate this problem, mutually orthogonal Golay complementary sequences (MOGCS) can be used. MOGCS allow the simultaneous transmission of two CGCS pairs to be implemented, yielding the acoustic data for two image frames in one data acquisition cycle. The main objective of this work was an experimental study of the most crucial parameters of the received acoustic signals, e.g. the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the side-lobes level (SLL) of the signal and the axial resolution, obtained from simultaneous transmission of two pairs of CGCS comprising a MOGCS set to demonstrate their feasibility of being used in ultrasonography. For this purpose, a simultaneous synthetic transmit aperture method (SSTA) was proposed. The SSTA is based on MOGCS transmission and simultaneous reconstruction of two image frames from a single data acquisition cycle. This doubles the image reconstruction rate in comparison with conventional CGCS signals. In this paper, the ultrasound data from a perfect reflector, commercial phantoms and in vivo measurements were analysed. Two 16-bit long CGCS pairs comprising the MOGCS set were programmed and transmitted using the Verasonics Vantage™ research ultrasound system equipped with a Philips ATL L7-4 linear array ultrasound probe. It was shown that the signal parameters and overall quality of reconstructed B-mode images did not deteriorate when using the MOGCS in comparison to the conventional CGCS and short pulse signals explored so far.},

	abstract = {Within the compressive sensing (CS) framework, one effective way to increase the likelihood of successful signal reconstruction is to employ random processes in the construction of the sensing matrix. This study presents a 3D holey cavity, with diverse frequency modes, to spectrally code, that is, randomize, the ultrasound wave fields. The simulated results show that the use of such a cavity enables imaging simple or complex targets, such as spheres or the letter E, by only a single transceiver—something that is not possible without the use of a coding structure like the cavity. The effect of noise on imaging results and the size of the targets on the first-order Born approximation (BA) are also investigated. Moreover, this study attempts to optimize the cavity, based on a single numerical metric, such as the sum of singular values (SSV) or mutual coherence (MC). Yet, it will be shown that neither of these metrics can consistently compare the norm-one imaging performance between two cavities of different materials or hole sizes. This leaves finding a quantitative metric for these kinds of optimizations an open problem.},

Working towards this prospect, this letter presents the recent developments of a standardized acquisition workflow using a novel dual-probe ultrasound robot, for a project known as intelligent Fetal Imaging and Diagnosis (iFIND). The workflow includes an abdominal surface mapping step to obtain a non-parametric spline surface, a rule-based end-point calculation method to position each individual joint, and a motor synchronization method to achieve a smooth motion towards a target point. The design and implementation of the robot are first presented in this letter and the proposed workflow is then explained in detail with simulation and volunteer experiments performed and analyzed. The closed-form analytical solution to the specific motion planning problem has demonstrated a reliable performance controlling the robot to move towards the expected scanning areas and the calculated proximity of the robot to the surface shows that the robot maintains a safe distance while moving around the abdomen. The volunteer study has successfully demonstrated the reliable working and controllability of the robot in terms of acquiring desired ultrasound views. Our future work will focus on improving the motion planning, and on integrating the proposed standardized acquisition workflow with newly-developed ultrasound image processing methods to obtain diagnostic results in an accurate and consistent way.},

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture focusing (SAF) and coherence factor weighting (CFW) have been used to improve the lateral resolution of ultrasound images. Although the two methods are effective for array-based ultrasound imaging, many researchers have also employed the methods for single-element-based imaging including intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. For single-element-based imaging, CFW is generally calculated from the scanlines obtained by SAF and applied to the scanline obtained after coherent summation of the SAF delayed scanlines, which is called a SAF-CFW method. In the paper, a theoretical model was derived to explore the effectiveness of SAF and CFW for single-element-based imaging, and the model was used to explain that SAF is not effective for IVUS imaging in terms of enhancing the spatial resolution, although it has the advantage of improving a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). This means that the SAF-CFW method is not optimal for improving the spatial resolution of IVUS imaging. In contrast, it was found in simulations and experiments that applying CFW to the target scanline itself is beneficial for the spatial resolution rather than a coherent summed scanline for IVUS SAF imaging, but CNR was not as good as SAF and SAF-CFW. As a result of both simulation and experimentation, it could be concluded that focused IVUS transducers without the application of those methods may be more advantageous to improve the spatial and contrast resolution simultaneously, considering the system complexity in the implementation of such imaging methods.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect that lateral spatial resolution of ultrasound has on finger flexion classification. The objective's purpose leads toward the development of a wearable human machine interface (HMI) using single-element ultrasonic sensors with non-focused ultrasound. Ultrasound radiofrequency (RF) signals were acquired using a linear array ultrasound probe in B-mode while performing the individual finger flexions from five healthy volunteers. Each B-mode frame is composed of 127 parallel ultrasound RF signals along the lateral direction within a 40-mm width. To reduce the lateral resolution of ultrasound data artificially, the RF signals were averaged into a reduced number of lateral columns. Across ten independent arm experiments the classification accuracy at 127 channels (full resolution) resulted in the first and third quartile to be 80-92\%. Averaging into four RF signals (simulating 10-mm wide ultrasound beams from each channel) could achieve a median classification accuracy of 87\% using the proposed feature extraction method with the discrete wavelet transform. Our results show low resolutions could achieve high accuracies to that of full resolution. We also conducted a preliminary study using a multichannel single-element ultrasound system with lightweight, flexible, and wearable ultrasonic sensors (WUSs) using non-focused ultrasound. Each WUS had an ultrasound sensing area of 20mm by 20mm. Three WUSs were attached on one subject's forearm and ultrasound RF signals were acquired during individual finger flexions. A mean classification accuracy of 98\% was obtained with F1 scores ranging between 95 - 98\% (across five finger flexions).},

In this article, we present a novel approach to the efficient design of FPGA beamformers for synthetic aperture (SA) imaging via the use of software-based high-level synthesis techniques. Software kernels (coded in OpenCL) were first developed to stage-wise handle SA beamforming operations, and their corresponding FPGA logic circuitry was emulated through a high-level synthesis framework. After design space analysis, the fine-tuned OpenCL kernels were compiled into register transfer level descriptions to configure an FPGA as a beamformer module. The processing performance of this beamformer was assessed through a series of offline emulation experiments that sought to derive beamformed images from SA channel-domain raw data (40-MHz sampling rate, 12 bit resolution). With 128 channels, our FPGA-based SA beamformer can achieve 41 frames per second (fps) processing throughput (3.44 × 108 pixels per second for frame size of 256 × 256 pixels) at 31.5 W power consumption (1.30 fps/W power efficiency). It utilized 86.9\% of the FPGA fabric and operated at a 196.5 MHz clock frequency (after optimization). Based on these findings, we anticipate that FPGA and high-level synthesis can together foster rapid prototyping of real-time ultrasound processor modules at low power consumption budgets.},

Ultrasonic velocity, together with physical properties including viscosity, density, and macronutrient composition of the tested dairy products, was determined. The results show that the ultrasonic velocity in the dairy products increased with a decreasing fat content of the samples. There was a significant positive correlation between the velocity and density, which was further related to the impact of the fat content. Water dilution caused different changes in velocity, depending on the ratio of fat content and continuous phase of the samples. A higher fat content of the samples resulted in a smaller effect of dilution on velocity. This study showed that the ultrasonic system allows rapid and non-destructive analysis for comparison of liquid dairy samples and appears promising for detection of dilution.},

Commonly available metal detectors are sold as handheld systems, which enable only progressive, lengthy, time-consuming search. Importantly, a part of the investigated area can thus be easily missed, and the probability that a metal object will not be found increases substantially. This problem, however, is eliminable via the automatic position tracking mode embedded in the solution obtained through our research. The proposed system facilitates using the spider web coil simultaneously for wireless charging and metal detection by pulse induction. The topology of the detector can emit variable pulse lengths, thus allowing the device to detect more types of metal and to adapt itself to the permeability of the soil. The coil has a branch in a relevant part of the winding to reduce undesirable electromagnetic interference during the charging. On the transmitting side of the topology, impedance matching is included to maintain the maximum spatial gap variability. By changing the position of the receiving side, the output voltage changes; therefore, a high efficiency DC/DC converter is employed. The individual battery cells demonstrate different internal resistances, requiring us to apply a new method to balance the cells voltage. The system can be utilized on self-guided vehicles or drones; advantageously, a GPS resending the coordinates to a mesh radio allows for accurate positioning. With the mesh topology, potential cooperation between the multiple systems is possible. The setup utilizes the same coil for wireless power transfer and detection.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound tongue imaging is used to visualise the intra-oral articulators during speech production. It is utilised in a range of applications, including speech and language therapy and phonetics research. Ultrasound and speech audio are recorded simultaneously, and in order to correctly use this data, the two modalities should be correctly synchronised. Synchronisation is achieved using specialised hardware at recording time, but this approach can fail in practice resulting in data of limited usability. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically synchronising ultrasound and audio after data collection. We first investigate the tolerance of expert ultrasound users to synchronisation errors in order to find the thresholds for error detection. We use these thresholds to define accuracy scoring boundaries for evaluating our system. We then describe our approach for automatic synchronisation, which is driven by a self-supervised neural network, exploiting the correlation between the two signals to synchronise them. We train our model on data from multiple domains with different speaker characteristics, different equipment, and different recording environments, and achieve an accuracy {\textgreater}92.4\% on held-out in-domain data. Finally, we introduce a novel resource, the Cleft dataset, which we gathered with a new clinical subgroup and for which hardware synchronisation proved unreliable. We apply our model to this out-of-domain data, and evaluate its performance subjectively with expert users. Results show that users prefer our model’s output over the original hardware output 79.3\% of the time. Our results demonstrate the strength of our approach and its ability to generalise to data from new domains.},

	abstract = {With over half a century of medical ultrasound support, proven efficacy, and increased popularity, why is it that over half our planet’s population does not have access to ultrasound imaging? In 2015 when I joined the doctoral program, I embarked to not only understand this problem but to provide a solution. This document will walk you through this journey, detailing the challenge of creating my very own ultrasound system with the purpose of it being highly accessible to people who need it the most. I had the vision to take this further; not only did I aim to create an open-source portable ultrasound- I also wanted to see this in the hands of users.

      This dissertation will show you how collaboration between students of varying disciplines can help propel research to the point of product development. A full ultrasound system including both hardware and software has been developed and tested using commercial ultrasound phantoms. This document will present progress chronologically, starting with the first attempts at using audible piezoelectric buzzers to generate a signal, where the first proof of concept is met. In this dissertation, you will follow the continuous development of a 1) ultrasound analog circuit, 2) mechanical transducer probe, 3) analog signal acquisition system, and 4) imaging software coupled with the user interface.

      The open-source portable ultrasound research has been successful in providing both hardware and software solutions, combined as a single package in an end-to-end integrated system. This has never been done before. During a time when “data is gold”, this project has also created an open platform where users can collect and share data, enabling collaborations and propulsion of open-access medical screening technologies. This research has developed the lowest-cost 3D scanning ultrasound transducer that we know of at this time. This is inherently novel and transcendental.},

	abstract = {Ischemic stroke is one of the most deadly illnesses in the world, leading to high mortality. Due to lung disease, stroke is the abnormal growth of cells characterized by a single irregular cell and spreads throughout the body. Therefore, to detect and heal the affected area at an early stage, it is necessary to detect the affected area after application. Ischemic stroke is generally regarded as an essential indicator of stroke rehabilitation care. The previous method uses SVM (Support Vector Machine) and STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform Algorithm) to process an image processing system based on stroke detection. This is more accurate and efficient for CT (Computed Tomography) images. The conversion method is significantly slower, and the advanced risk architecture cannot verify the image. The proposed FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) are used to develop image processing and easily interact with the database without introducing complexity. FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is mainly realized by ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit). The system speeds up detecting strokes and lung diseases and can be used as a single process system or another biomedical imaging system component. According to the medical big data system, the image processing system relies on bilateral filtering, edge detection, multiple thresholds, image segmentation, morphological image processing, and image labeling to collect stroke symptoms.},

Super-resolution ultrasound imaging is an emerging technology that can identify the microvasculature noninvasively, with unprecedented spatial resolution beyond the acoustic diffraction limit. Therefore, it is a promising approach for diagnosing and monitoring the development of diseases. In this review, we introduce current super-resolution ultrasound imaging approaches and their preclinical applications on different animals and disease models. Future directions and challenges to overcome for clinical translations are also discussed.},

	abstract = {High-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) imaging has emerged as an essential tool for pre-clinical studies and clinical applications such as ophthalmic and dermatologic imaging. HFUS imaging systems based on array transducers capable of dynamic receive focusing have considerably improved the image quality in terms of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to those by the single-element transducer-based one. However, the array system still suffers from low spatial resolution and SNR in out-of-focus regions, resulting in a blurred image and a limited penetration depth. In this paper, we present synthetic aperture imaging with a virtual source (SA-VS) for an ophthalmic application using a high-frequency convex array transducer. The performances of the SA-VS were evaluated with phantom and ex vivo experiments in comparison with the conventional dynamic receive focusing method. Pre-beamformed radio-frequency (RF) data from phantoms and excised bovine eye were acquired using a custom-built 64-channel imaging system. In the phantom experiments, the SA-VS method showed improved lateral resolution (\&gt;10\%) and sidelobe level (\&gt;4.4 dB) compared to those by the conventional method. The SNR was also improved, resulting in an increased penetration depth: 16 mm and 23 mm for the conventional and SA-VS methods, respectively. Ex vivo images with the SA-VS showed improved image quality at the entire depth and visualized structures that were obscured by noise in conventional imaging.},

Ultrasound imaging has often been used to study the properties of human muscles as a non-invasive and reliable method. However, aspect ratio measurements are traditional FPGAs by manually digitizing the reference point. Therefore, it is subjectively time consuming and error prone. Muscle volume in the human region estimated in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging in six subjects by ultrasound. In both methods, machine learning takes along the muscle belly and cross-sectional area of the muscle in each scan, digitization. Muscle mass was calculated by processing the muscle as a series of truncated cones.
